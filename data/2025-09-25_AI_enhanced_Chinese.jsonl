The SED, and resulting\nbolometric corrections, depend strongly on SMBH mass and Eddington ratio, but\nonly weakly on spin and inclination. Increasing SMBH mass produces cooler disks\npeaking at lower frequencies, whereas higher Eddington ratios (and spins) yield\nhotter disks peaking at higher frequencies. Larger inclinations suppress the\nvisible--UV portion of the SED, whereas X-ray emission remains nearly\nisotropic.

The X-ray band is reliable, though\ndependence on the Eddington ratio introduces a wide dynamic range.

Using\na sample of 23 simulated galaxies from the Auriga project, we analysed the\nevolution of heavy elements produced by stellar nucleosynthesis. To study the\nchemical evolution of the stellar halo, bulge, and warm and cold discs of the\nmodel galaxies, we applied a decomposition method to characterise the\ndistribution of chemical elements at $z=0$ and traced back their origin. Our\nfindings indicate that each stellar component has a distinctive chemical trend\ndespite galaxy-to-galaxy variations. Specifically, stellar haloes are\n$\\alpha$-enhanced relative to other components, representing the oldest\npopulations, with [Fe/H] ~ $-$0.6 and a high fraction of ex situ stars of ~\n50%. They are followed by the warm ([Fe/H] ~ $-$0.1) and cold ([Fe/H] ~ 0)\ndiscs, with in situ fractions of ~ 90% and ~ 95%, respectively. Alternatively,\nbulges are mainly formed in situ but host more diverse stellar populations,\nwith [Fe/H] abundance extending over ~ 1 dex around the solar value. We\nconclude that one of the main drivers shaping the chemical properties of the\ngalactic components in our simulations is the age-metallicity relation. The\nbulges are the least homogeneous component of the sample, as they present\ndifferent levels of contribution from young stars in addition to the old\nstellar component. Conversely, the cold discs appear very similar in all\nchemical properties, despite important differences in their typical formation\ntimes. Finally, we find that a significant fraction of stars in the warm discs\nwere in the cold disc at birth.

Using a comprehensive\ncross-matched sample of 277 LSB galaxies from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy\nCatalog Release 2 and the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array\nCatalog, we gain an in-depth view of the star formation process in the LSB\nregime.
