### [1] [Plasma lens with frequency-dependent dispersion measure effects on fast radio bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20424)
*Yu-Bin Wang,Xia Zhou,Abdusattar Kurban*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该研究发现射电脉冲在不均匀等离子体中传播时，其图像位置和色散度都与频率有关，解决了经典等离子透镜模型的矛盾，解释了快速射电暴（FRB）的频率依赖性峰值通量密度，特别是重复FRB 180814.J0422+73的特性，并提出其可能源自磁化致密天体的磁层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典等离子透镜理论假设等离子体分布与频率无关，但实际观测到的FRB存在频率依赖性峰值通量密度现象，这与经典模型的预测不符，因此需要重新审视等离子透镜效应的机制。

Method: 作者通过建立一个明确考虑频率依赖色散度（DM）的框架，采用幂律关系（DM ∝ ν^γ）来描述等离子体分布，并分析信号在结构化等离子体中传播时的频率依赖性图像位置和色散度。

Result: 研究结果表明，信号放大随频率降低而系统性减弱，这为解释FRB的频率依赖性峰值通量密度提供了合理依据，尤其适用于重复FRB 180814.J0422+73。

Conclusion: 这些发现说明FRB可能起源于磁化致密天体的磁层，并且通过分析不同频率下的子脉冲，可以更准确地研究FRB的本征性质。

Abstract: Radio signals propagating through inhomogeneous plasma media deviate from
their original paths, producing frequency-dependent magnification effects. In
this paper, after reviewing the classical plasma-lensing theory, we have found
a fundamental contradiction: the classical model assumes that the distribution
of lensing plasma medium is related to the frequency-independent image
position; however, our analysis demonstrates that both the image position
($\theta(\nu)$) and dispersion measure (DM$(\nu)$) are inherently
frequency-dependent when signals traverse a structured plasma medium.
  We have been able to resolve this paradox by developing a framework that
explicitly incorporates frequency-dependent dispersion measures (DMs) following
power-law relationships ($\rm DM\propto \nu^\gamma$). Our analysis shows that
the signal magnification decreases systematically with decreasing frequency,
offering a plausible explanation for the frequency-dependent peak flux
densities observed in fast radio bursts (FRBs), particularly in the case of the
repeating FRB 180814.J0422+73. Our results suggest these FRBs could originate
from the magnetized compact star magnetospheres. By considering these
plasma-lensing effects on the sub-pulses of an FRB across different
frequencies, we have the ability to more accurately investigate the intrinsic
properties of FRBs via precise measurements of radio signals.

Abstract: Galactic PeVatrons are astrophysical sources accelerating particles up to a
few PeV (~10$^{15}$ eV). The primary method to identify both electron and
proton PeVatrons is the observation of $\gamma$-ray radiation at ultra-high
energies (UHE; E$>$100 TeV). In 2021, LHAASO detected 14 steady $\gamma$-ray
sources with photon energies above 100 TeV and up to 1.4 PeV. Most of these
sources can be plausibly associated with objects such as supernova remnants,
pulsar wind nebulae, and stellar clusters. However, LHAASO J0341$+$5258 is
detected as an unidentified PeVatron, emitting $\gamma$ rays at energies above
hundreds of TeV. It is extended in nature and notably bright, with a flux $>$
20% of the Crab Nebula's flux above 25 TeV. Multiwavelength observations are
required to identify the PeVatron responsible for the UHE $\gamma$ rays,
understand the source morphology and association, and shed light on the
emission processes. Here, we will present the results from the VERITAS and HAWC
observations of this PeVatron, along with a discussion on potential emission
scenarios through multiwavelength modeling.

Motivation: ALP作为新物理的候选者，其与伽马射线的相互作用在恒星磁场中能产生能量依赖的调制，但标准统计方法在复杂模型和大量干扰参数下不够精确。

Method: 通过模拟CTAO的观测数据，建模NGC 1275活动星系核的伽马射线发射，考虑光子-ALP混合、宇宙微波背景吸收和CTAO仪器响应，应用Swyft框架进行模拟-基于推理以推断ALP质量与耦合强度的后验分布。

Conclusion: 模拟-基于推理方法，尤其是TMNRE，为未来利用CTAO观测数据对ALP参数进行精确约束提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that couple
to photons, are among the most actively investigated candidates for new physics
beyond the Standard Model. Their interaction with gamma rays in the presence of
astrophysical magnetic fields can leave characteristic, energy-dependent
modulations in observed spectra. Capturing such subtle features requires
precise statistical inference, but standard likelihood-based methods often fall
short when faced with complex models, large number of nuisance parameters and
limited analytical tractability. In this work, we investigate the application
of simulation-based inference (SBI), specifically Truncated Marginal Neural
Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), to constrain ALP parameters using simulated
observations from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We
model the gamma-ray emission from the active galactic nucleus NGC 1275,
accounting for photon-ALP mixing, extragalactic background light (EBL)
absorption, and the full CTAO instrument response. Leveraging the Swyft
framework, we infer posteriors for the ALP mass and coupling strength and
demonstrate its potential to extract meaningful constraints on ALPs from future
real gamma-ray data with CTAO.

### [4] [The First 4 Years of SN 1993J Revisited: Geometric $m$-ring Modeling of the Radio Shell with Closure Quantities Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20601)
*Joseph R. Farah,Logan J. Prust,Giacomo Terreran,D. Andrew Howell,Michael Bietenholz,Norbert Bartel,Curtis McCully,Michael D. Johnson*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper re-analyzes SN 1993J's early ejecta evolution using a new VLBI technique, finding consistent power-law expansion and stable ejecta width, with new azimuthal brightness modulation insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding of the ejecta evolution and interaction mechanisms of SN 1993J by utilizing higher angular resolution techniques and providing more detailed constraints for advanced simulations.

Method: The study employs a new VLBI analysis technique with higher angular resolution, adopting the m-ring model as a phenomenological alternative to the spherical shell model. Closure quantities are used for calibration-insensitive constraints, allowing for comparisons with previous results from the same data sets.

Result: The analysis found a power-law exponent of $\omega=0.80\pm0.01$ for the ejecta expansion, consistent with shell-fitting analyses. It also reported estimates of ejecta width at t < 1000 days, showing no significant evolution. The azimuthal brightness modulation was observed to rotate from east to south-southwest and then evolve to more complex behavior.

Conclusion: The results provide new insights into the ejecta structure and dynamics of SN 1993J, offering more detailed constraints that can enhance the testing of advanced explosion and interaction simulations.

Abstract: SN 1993J is the best-studied radio supernova, with observations using
very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) spanning from within weeks of
explosion through nearly three decades of ejecta evolution. Imaging and
modeling techniques have revealed an expanding shell-like ejecta structure,
with a width well-constrained after ~1000 days. In this work, we present a
re-analysis of the first ~1700 days of SN 1993J evolution, using a new VLBI
analysis technique with somewhat intrinsically higher angular resolution and
compare our results with those from previous conventional techniques. We adopt
the m-ring model, with potentially somewhat higher angular resolution, but only
as a phenomenological alternative to the physically-motivated spherical shell
model used in past analyses and shape the profile to approximately match that
of the shell. We use closure quantities only, providing calibration insensitive
constraints on ejecta geometry and largely independent comparisons with
previous results from the same data sets. Using this approach we find the
ejecta expanding with a power-law exponent $\omega=0.80\pm0.01$ averaged for
the time from 175 to 1693 days, consistent with shell-fitting analyses. For the
first time, we report estimates of the ejecta width at t < 1000 days -- as
early as 264 days post-explosion -- finding a mean fractional width with
standard deviation of $0.24 \pm 0.04$ (of the radius) with no significant
evolution. We present a fit of the azimuthal brightness modulation over time
with the maximum of a horseshoe pattern rotating from east to south-southwest
from 175 to 1000 d and then evolving to a more complex behavior, quantifying
previous results from images only. The constraints on the angular brightness
modulation and width over time and ~700 days earlier than existing analyses
provide an avenue to test more advanced simulations of the explosion and
interaction mechanisms.

TL;DR: 该研究在ASKAP VAST调查的圆形极化源样本中发现了两个脉冲星，并确认它们具有高色散测量值。这两个脉冲星显示出极端的脉冲扩展，尤其是PSR J1837-0616，其在1.9 GHz时的散射时间尺度达到343毫秒。


<details>

Motivation: 研究旨在利用无线电连续谱图像中的圆形极化特性来识别高散射脉冲星。这可以帮助理解脉冲星的分布及其与星际介质的相互作用。

Method: 使用ASKAP望远镜的无线电连续谱图像识别出四个圆形极化源，然后通过帕克斯（Murriyang）射电望远镜进一步观测确认这两个源为正常脉冲星。

Result: 确定了PSR J1646-4451和PSR J1837-0616这两个脉冲星，它们具有高色散测量值和极端脉冲扩展。特别是在1.9 GHz下，PSR J1837-0616的散射时间尺度达到343毫秒。

Conclusion: 研究结果证明了利用圆形极化在无线电连续谱图像中识别高散射脉冲星的有效性，展望了未来宽视场无线电连续谱调查在发现更多极端脉冲星方面的潜力。

Abstract: We report the discovery and timing of two pulsars from a sample of four
circularly polarized sources identified in radio continuum images taken as part
of the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) Variables and Slow Transients (VAST)
survey. Observations with the Parkes (Murriyang) radio telescope confirmed both
sources as normal pulsars with high dispersion measures. PSR J1646$-$4451 has a
spin period of 217 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 928 $\rm cm^{-3} \, pc$,
while PSR J1837$-$0616 exhibits a spin period of 118 ms and a DM of 793 $\rm
cm^{-3} \, pc$. These pulsars show extreme pulse broadening due to scattering,
with measured scattering timescales of 290 ms and 343 ms at observing
frequencies of 1.8 GHz and 1.9 GHz, respectively. These measurements imply
extrapolated scattering timescales at 1 GHz of 2479 ms and 2154 ms, placing
them among the most heavily scattered pulsars known to date. Our findings
underscore the potential of using circular polarization in radio continuum
images as a tool for identifying highly scattered pulsars. Future wide-field
radio continuum surveys are poised to uncover a broader population of extreme
pulsars particularly those that are heavily scattered at 1.4 GHz, intrinsically
faint, or residing in binaries$-$offering valuable insights into both pulsar
demographics and the complex structure of the interstellar medium.

Abstract: We report on the follow-up observations of circularly polarized sources
identified in the MeerKAT image-based survey of the Galactic bulge. Using the
Parkes radio telescope, we observed sixteen circularly polarized sources with
the UWL receiver and detected nine pulsars among which six of them are new
discoveries. All pulsars are fast rotators with spin periods under 100\,ms.
Among the new discoveries five are millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and one has a
spin period of 55\,ms. At least four new MSPs exhibit clear signs of binary
motion in their discovery observations. The dispersion measures (DMs) of these
pulsars fall between 18 and 330\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$, which is lower than expected
for Galactic bulge members and indicates that these pulsars lie in the
foreground along the line of sight rather than within the bulge itself. This is
the first time such a large number of pulsars have been confirmed via an
image-based survey. These discoveries underscore the exceptional efficacy of
circular polarization selection in image-based pulsar surveys, and demonstrate
the powerful synergy between high-sensitivity imaging and targeted time-domain
follow-up using wide-band receivers and strengthen prospects for future deep
pulsation searches$-$e.g., with MeerKAT or the forthcoming SKA or DSA-2000$-$to
uncover the true millisecond pulsar population in the Galactic bulge.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most frequently observed outcome of
core-collapse explosions and provide a valuable window into the physical
mechanisms governing the deaths of massive stars. However, estimates of
explosion properties based on optical light curve modeling often show tension
with the predictions of modern neutrino-driven explosion models. In particular,
when based on light curves from the explosions of red supergiant (RSG) tied to
specific stellar wind models, many SNe II are found to originate from low-mass
progenitors yet exhibit unusually high explosion energies ($E_{\rm K}$), far
exceeding theoretical predictions. In this study, we incorporate late-phase
(nebular) spectroscopy to estimate the helium core mass of the progenitor
($M_{\rm He\,core}$), which serves as an additional constraint to break
degeneracies in light curve modeling. This approach is applied to a sample of
32 well-observed SNe II, using a light curve model grid constructed from RSGs
with arbitrarily stripped hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than assuming a fixed
wind model. Examining the resulting correlations among the physical parameters,
we find that the tension between the observed $M_{\rm He\,core}$-$E_{\rm K}$
and $E_{\rm K}$-$M_{\rm Ni}$ relations and those predicted by neutrino-driven
explosion models has significantly lessened by incorporating nebular
spectroscopy in light curve modeling. This study highlights the crucial role of
nebular spectroscopy in interpreting SNe II observations and provides support
to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism as the dominant engine powering
these events.

Abstract: Large Array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (LACT) is an array of
32 Cherenkov telescopes with 6-meter diameter mirrors to be constructed at the
LHAASO site, aiming to enhance our understanding of ultra-high energy gamma ray
astronomy. This work presents a detailed performance assessment of the LACT
array, focusing on the IRFs for both an 8-telescope subarray configuration
optimized for large zenith angle observations (60{\deg}) and the full
32-telescope array, with a particular emphasis on a 20{\deg} zenith angle
configuration for lower energy threshold observations.
  We have generated IRFs using extensive Monte Carlo simulations of gamma-ray
showers and the detector response. The IRFs include the effective area, angular
resolution, and energy resolution as a function of energy and offset angle.
Crucially, these IRFs are produced in the standard Data format for Gamma ray
astronomy (GADF), ensuring interoperability with existing analysis tools like
Gammapy and ctools and enabling seamless integration into scientific workflows.
  In this work, we also have used these GADF-format IRFs to simulate
observations towards the Galactic Center Region.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了X射线反射光谱学中发射率剖面假设对黑洞自转测量的影响，发现幂律模型对低高度灯柱状的冠状层在长曝光和低倾角下有较好效果，但高高度或高倾角时存在系统性偏差。


<details>

Motivation: 为了确定发射率剖面假设对黑洞自转测量结果的影响，研究者们需要评估不同模型在特定条件下的可靠性。

Method: 利用relxill模型套件生成的NuSTAR模拟光谱，研究了使用幂律或断幂律发射率剖面拟合时引入的系统性偏差。

Result: 对于低高度灯柱状的冠状层，简单幂律模型能准确恢复自转参数，而断幂律模型在简单幂律已经足够的情况下引入了退化问题。在高高度或高倾角的冠状层中，两种模型均产生显著的系统性偏差，且无法通过更长的曝光时间解决。

Conclusion: 幂律近似在紧凑冠状层中可靠，但在复杂情况下需要几何特定模型，以确保准确的自转测量。

Abstract: The emissivity profile assumed in X-ray reflection spectroscopy significantly
impacts black hole spin measurements. Using simulated NuSTAR spectra generated
for lamppost and disk-like coronae with the relxill model suite, we evaluate
systematic biases introduced when fitting with power-law or broken power-law
emissivity profiles. We find that a simple power-law can accurately recover
spins for low-height lamppost coronae with long exposures and low inclination
angle, while broken power-laws introduce degeneracies when the simple power-law
already performs adequately. However, for extended or high-height coronae,
especially at high inclinations, both models produce large systematic biases
unresolved by longer exposure times. Our results demonstrate that power-law
approximations are reliable for compact coronae, highlighting the need for
geometry-specific models in complex cases.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose that the high eccentricity of the stellar orbit in Gaia BH3 system
could be excited through a secular resonance effect if the inner dark object
is, in effect, a tight and eccentric black hole binary (BHB). During the
orbital decay of the inner BHB, the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary
matches that of the outer stellar orbit, and this resonance advection can drive
the outer eccentricity into some extreme values. For a Gaia BH3-like system, we
show that a near equal-mass ($q=0.8$) BHB with an initial semi-major axis of
1--3 au and an initial eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.95$ is able to excite the outer
orbit to the observed value, leaving a current BHB with semi-major axis
0.25--0.5 au and eccentricity $\sim 0.8$. The eccentric inner BHB imprints two
observable signatures on the outer star: (1) short-term RV modulations with an
amplitude $\lesssim 100$ m/s and (2) long-term apsidal precession with a rate
$\lesssim 0.1^{\circ}$/yr. Although neither of these is detected in the
currently available astrometry and RV data, we show that these signals are
detectable with the full Gaia astrometry data and dedicated high-precision
and/or long-term RV observations. Our work provides a new perspective on the
dynamical formation of Gaia BH3, and the methodology is readily applicable to
similar systems such as HD 130298, Gaia BH1, and Gaia BH2.

Abstract: Cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere of an astrophysical object produce
showers of secondary particles that may then scape into space. Here we obtain
the flux of gammas and neutrinos of energy $E>10$ GeV emited by the Sun,
Jupiter and Earth. We show that, while the solar magnetic field induces an
albedo flux of gammas from all the points in the Sun's surface, the dipolar
magnetic field in the planets implies gammas only from the very peripheral
region. Neutrinos, in contrast, can cross these objects and emerge from any
point in their surface. The emission from these astrophysical objects is above
the diffuse flux from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium and
has a distinct spectrum and gamma to neutrino ratio.

Abstract: Microquasars are increasingly recognized as efficient particle accelerators,

SS 433 stands out as a unique system with precessing relativistic jets embedded
within the W50 supernova remnant. Recent detections of very- and
ultra-high-energy gamma rays from SS 433 have solidified its role as a key
laboratory for studying particle acceleration in jet-powered astrophysical
sources. We present results from over 100 hours of observations of SS 433 with
VERITAS, spanning more than a decade. These high-resolution measurements allow
for a detailed morphological study of the eastern and western jet lobes with an
angular resolution of <0.1{\deg}. By analyzing the spatial and spectral
characteristics of the gamma-ray emission, we investigate the particle
acceleration mechanisms within the jets and at the jet-medium interaction in
W50.

Abstract: X-ray pulsars (XRPs) consist of a magnetized neutron star (NS) and an optical
donor star. The NS accretes matter from the donor star producing pulsed X-ray
emission. In most cases the donor stars are Be stars, and accretion is
episodic, that is, the NSs are generally X-ray dim, but occasionally experience
outbursts. Here, we carry out a statistical study with the X-ray monitoring
data, and obtain strong correlations between the spin periods of the NSs and
the outburst parameters for the first time. We show that XRPs containing faster
rotating NSs tend to display more violent eruptions. In addition, pulsating
ultraluminous X-ray sources in nearby galaxies follow the similar relationship.
We demonstrate that most of these systems are close to the spin equilibrium,
and that brighter pulsars have acquired more angular momentum by accreting
matter from their companion stars, resulting in faster rotating NSs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Both the Rubin Observatory and the first telescopes of the CTAO will be
collecting data by 2026, marking a new era in optical and gamma-ray astronomy.
Compared to predecessors, their enhanced sensitivity will extend extragalactic
observations to a redshift of at least 2.5. This advancement offers insights
into non-thermal astrophysical sources, particularly blazars. The 3-night
cadence monitoring with Rubin, in one of its six filters, will produce blazar
light curves that, when combined with targeted in-depth observations from the
CTAO, could help distinguish acceleration and radiative models. Existing data
from the ZTF and Fermi-LAT, though less sensitive, offer insights into what
Rubin and the CTAO may achieve. However, the real-time processing of the
immense data stream coming from Rubin/LSST presents a major challenge.
  Addressing this challenge is the work of brokers such as Fink, which we
develop for multi-messenger astrophysics. Fink processes data in real-time
before sending relevant information to other observatories like the CTAO. In
this contribution, we present how we characterize the optical variability of
blazars that emit in the gamma-ray range using the ZTF, with timescales
spanning from the intra-night to multi-years. We identify properties in the
resulting parameter space that could not only enable the identification of
blazar-like sources, but also the characterization of the continuum of states.
We describe our fast identification of transitions from one state to another,
enabling the trigger of observations in the gamma-ray band and follow-up
spectroscopic observations. Finally, we review the communication channel we set
from the ZTF to the CTAO via Fink for blazars and discuss its outlook in light
of the Rubin Observatory. This method is also applicable to other astrophysical
sources and helps lay the groundwork for a fruitful era for time-domain
astronomy.

Result: 未发现显著的射电脉冲信号，仅在GRB 200925B中观测到爆发后约60-360秒的小幅度射电流量增加，其余三个GRBs没有相关信号。对于GRB 200925B和GRB 240414A，分别约束了$oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol}}}}}}}}}}}}}}$参数的上限，分别为$4.2 	imes 10^{-4}$和$2.8 	imes 10^{-4}$。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，当前观测未检测到磁流主导喷流的明确迹象，但为该参数提供了新的上限约束，支持了以前的GRB研究结论。未来需要更高灵敏度的射电观测来进一步验证磁流主导的喷流模型。

Abstract: Relativistic jets generated in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) produce luminous
transient events, yet the fundamentals of jet composition and radiation
mechanisms remain unclear. One means of identifying a magnetically-dominated
outflow would be detection of prompt, coherent radio emission at low
frequencies, and we are able to search for this using the LOw Frequency ARray
(LOFAR) coupled with modelling of high energy pulses detected by the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift). We present the rapid response mode follow-up
LOFAR observations of four long GRBs, each beginning within a few hundred
seconds of the initial Swift-BAT trigger. We interpreted our findings under the
framework of a magnetic wind model, predicting coherent radio emission
analogous to prompt emission pulses. Using 60 second and 180 second time sliced
imaging at 120-168 MHz, we obtain upper limits on radio pulse emission, finding
no significant signals. In the case of GRB 200925B, we observed a small
increase of radio flux seen at $\sim$60-360 s post burst. In this model, this
could represent the radio emission related to the Swift-BAT pulses, for a
redshift of $z=1.8$, however, with a low signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 2$, it
is not deemed significant enough to confirm coincident prompt radio and
gamma-ray emission. Instead, we can constrain the $\epsilon_{B}$ parameter,
deriving upper limits of $\epsilon_{B} < 4.2 \times 10^{-4}$ for GRB 200925B.
In GRB 240414A, with a reported redshift of $z=1.833$, we constrain
$\epsilon_{B} < 2.8 \times 10^{-4}$. We discuss these results in the context of
our whole LOFAR rapid response sample of six long gamma-ray bursts, finding our
$\epsilon_{B}$ values are generally consistent with previous GRB studies.

Abstract: The low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 1+4 stands out with its unique
properties. Despite being an old system, it hosts a strongly magnetized neutron
star (NS), a trait usually linked to younger systems. Its exceptionally long
orbital period (1160 days) and low eccentricity (0.101) imply that the NS
formed with minimal mass loss and a weak natal kick. These features
collectively point towards the NS having formed through the accretion induced
collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD). However, GX 1+4's unusually high peculiar
velocity (~ 189.36 km/s) defies standard AIC explanations. To address this
discrepancy, we propose a two-stage kick scenario within the AIC framework: an
initial natal kick followed by a delayed electromagnetic "rocket effect" kick.
Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that while the natal kick (< 100 km/s) can
generate a wide range of orbital eccentricities, the subsequent rocket kick (~
240-480 km/s) explains both the high systemic velocity and low eccentricity.
This two-stage kick mechanism naturally reproduces the observed characteristics
of GX 1+4, provided that the NS's initially buried magnetic field re-emerges
after the acceleration process ends. Our study represents the first attempt to
quantitatively constrain the kick velocities in GX 1+4 and underscores the
importance of possible rocket kicks in forming such peculiar LMXB systems.

Abstract: Accurate pulsar astrometric estimates play an essential role in almost all
high-precision pulsar timing experiments. Traditional pulsar timing techniques
refine these estimates by including them as free parameters when fitting a
model to observed pulse time-of-arrival measurements. However, reliable
sub-milliarcsecond astrometric estimations require years of observations and,
even then, power from red noise can be inadvertently absorbed into astrometric
parameter fits, biasing the resulting estimations and reducing our sensitivity
to red noise processes, including gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we
seek to mitigate these shortcomings by using pulsar astrometric estimates
derived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) as priors for the timing
fit. First, we calibrated a frame tie to account for the offsets between the
reference frames used in VLBI and timing. Then, we used the VLBI-informed
priors and timing-based likelihoods of several astrometric solutions consistent
with both techniques to obtain a maximum-posterior astrometric solution. We
found offsets between our results and the timing-based astrometric solutions,
which, if real, would lead to absorption of spectral power at frequencies of
interest for single-source GW searches. However, we do not find significant
power absorption due to astrometric fitting at the low-frequency domain of the
GW background.

Abstract: AT2018cqh is a unique optical tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in a
dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results
from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh
extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact
radio emission, unresolved at a scale of <~ 0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high
brightness temperature of $T_b$ ~> 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral
energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak
flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition
analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region
over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The
radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting
for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard
shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if
dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is
supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow
with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This
work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining
the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those
occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.

TL;DR: The paper reports the discovery of four new pulsars, including one millisecond pulsar and one young pulsar close to the Galactic Center, using Fermi-LAT data and Einstein@Home.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential explanation of the mysterious GeV gamma-ray excess around the Galactic Center, which might originate from unresolved pulsars in the bulge.

Method: The researchers analyzed Fermi-LAT data using the distributed volunteer computing system Einstein@Home to search for gamma-ray pulsations in the inner Galaxy and employed a phase-resolved difference imaging technique to separate pulsar signals from diffuse Galactic Center emission.

Result: Four new pulsars were discovered, including one millisecond pulsar and one young pulsar with the smallest angular separation to the Galactic Center of any known gamma-ray pulsar. No radio pulsations were detected from these pulsars.

Conclusion: Although the distances to the pulsars are uncertain, they are more likely foreground sources from the Galactic disk. The findings do not rule out the MSP explanation for the Galactic Center excess, as only a few members of the bulge population might have been detectable.

Abstract: The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has revealed a mysterious extended
excess of GeV gamma-ray emission around the Galactic Center, which can
potentially be explained by unresolved emission from a population of pulsars,
particularly millisecond pulsars (MSPs), in the Galactic bulge. We used the
distributed volunteer computing system Einstein@Home to search the Fermi-LAT
data for gamma-ray pulsations from sources in the inner Galaxy, to try to
identify the brightest members of this putative population. We discovered four
new pulsars, including one new MSP and one young pulsar whose angular
separation to the Galactic Center of 0.93{\deg} is the smallest of any known
gamma-ray pulsar. We demonstrate a phase-resolved difference imaging technique
that allows the flux from this pulsar to be disentangled from the diffuse
Galactic Center emission. No radio pulsations were detected from the four new
pulsars in archival radio observations or during the MPIfR-MeerKAT Galactic
Plane Survey. While the distances to these pulsars remain uncertain, we find
that it is more likely that they are all foreground sources from the Galactic
disk, rather than pulsars originating from the predicted bulge population.
Nevertheless, our results are not incompatible with an MSP explanation for the
GC excess, as only one or two members of this population would have been
detectable in our searches.

Abstract: The detection of very high-energy gamma-rays from M87 can provide crucial
insights into particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in jets. The
recent observations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO)
detector extend the energy range of TeV gamma-ray astronomy, and also the
variability study to the TeV energy domain. We have modelled the low state and
flare state multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of M87 within a
time-dependent framework. In our model, the low state gamma-ray flux results
from the emissions from the sub-parsec and the kilo-parsec scale jets of M87,
whereas the flare state gamma-ray flux is mainly produced in the sub-parsec
scale jet. We have shown that the spectral and temporal features of the TeV
gamma-ray spectrum of M87 are consistent with this two-zone model, where the
contribution from the sub-parsec scale jet significantly increases during the
flare state.
