Abstract: We study star formation over 12 Gyr using pop-cosmos, a generative model
trained on 26-band photometry of 420,000 COSMOS2020 galaxies (IRAC Ch.1 $<26$).
The model learns distributions over 16 SPS parameters via score-based
diffusion, matching observed colours and magnitudes. We compute the star
formation rate density (SFRD) to $z=3.5$ by directly integrating individual
galaxy SFRs. The SFRD peaks at $z=1.3\pm0.1$, with peak value $0.08\pm0.01$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We classify star-forming (SF) and quiescent
(Q) galaxies using specific SFR $<10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparing with $NUVrJ$
colour selection. The sSFR criterion yields up to 20% smaller quiescent
fractions across $0<z<3.5$, with $NUVrJ$-selected samples contaminated by
galaxies with sSFR up to $10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our sSFR-selected stellar mass
function shows a negligible number density of low-mass ($<10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$)
Q galaxies at $z\sim1$, where colour-selection shows a prominent increase.
Non-parametric star formation histories around the SFRD peak reveal distinct
patterns: SF galaxies show gradually decreasing SFR correlations with lookback
time ($r\sim1$ to $r\sim0$ over 13 Gyr), implying increasingly stochastic star
formation toward early epochs. Q galaxies exhibit full correlation ($r>0.95$)
during the most recent $\sim$300 Myr, then sharp decorrelation with earlier
star-forming epochs, marking clear quenching transitions. Massive
($10<\log_{10}(M_*/$M$_{\odot})<11$) galaxies quench on a time-scale of $\sim1$
Gyr, with mass assembly concentrated in their first 3.5 Gyr. Finally, AGN
activity (infrared luminosity) peaks as massive ($\sim10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$)
galaxies approach the transition between star-forming and quiescent states,
declining sharply once quiescence is established. This provides evidence that
AGN feedback operates in a critical regime during the $\sim1$ Gyr quenching
transition.

Abstract: We present the most precise and lowest-mass weak lensing measurements of
dwarf galaxies to date, enabled by spectroscopic lenses from the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and photometric lenses from the Dark Energy
Survey (DES) calibrated with DESI redshifts. Using DESI spectroscopy from the
first data release, we construct clean samples of galaxies with median stellar
masses $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.3-10.1$ and measure their weak lensing
signals with sources from DES, KiDS, and SDSS, achieving detections with $S/N$
up to 14 for dwarf galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})<$9.25) -- opening up a
new regime for lensing measurements of low-mass systems. Leveraging DES
photometry calibrated with DESI, we extend to a photometric dwarf sample of
over 700,000 galaxies, enabling robust lensing detections of dwarf galaxies
with combined $S/N=38$ and a significant measurement down to
$\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.0$. We show that the one-halo regime (scales
$\lesssim 0.15h^{-1}\rm Mpc$) is insensitive to various systematic and sample
selection effects, providing robust halo mass estimates, while the signal in
the two-halo regime depends on galaxy color and environment. These results
demonstrate that DESI already enables precise dwarf lensing measurements, and
that calibrated photometric samples extend this capability. Together, they pave
the way for novel constraints on dwarf galaxy formation and dark matter physics
with upcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Metals enhance the cooling efficiency of molecular clouds, promoting
fragmentation. Consequently, increasing the metallicity may boost the formation
of low-mass stars. Within the integrated galaxy initial mass function (IGIMF)
theory, this effect is empirically captured by a linear relation between the
slope of the low-mass stellar IMF, $\alpha_1$, and the metal mass fraction,
$Z$. This linear $\alpha_1$-$Z$ relation has been calibrated up to $\approx 2
\, Z_{\odot}$, though higher metallicity environments are known to exist. We
show that if the linear $\alpha_1$-$Z$ relation extends to higher metallicities
($[Z] \gtrsim 0.5$), massive star formation is suppressed entirely.
Alternatively, fragmentation efficiency may saturate beyond some metallicity
threshold if gravitational collapse cascades rapidly enough. To model this
behavior, we propose a logistic function describing the transition from
metallicity-sensitive to metallicity-insensitive fragmentation regimes. We
provide a user-friendly public code, pyIGIMF, which enables the instantaneous
computation of the IGIMF theory with the logistic $\alpha_1$-$Z$ relation.

TL;DR: 该研究利用SAGA巡天的数据，调查了低质量星系的矮星系人口，发现其星系质量函数（SMF）形状对环境依赖性较小，孤立矮星系的猝灭分数在$\rm M_\star \acksim 10^{8.5} M_\odot$时降至$\sim 10^{-3}$，并且尽管比HI动力学测量稍陡，但推断出的星系-暗物质关系（SHMR）与卫星系统的文献测量一致。然而，大箱体模拟在$\rm 10^8\lesssim M_\star/M_\odot\lesssim 10^9$的质量范围下高估了孤立星系的猝灭分数，强调了理解星系形成驱动力的复杂性，以及需要系统地观察不同环境中的矮星系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管过去的研究已经扩展了我们对卫星星系的数量和性质的理解，但对场矮星系的全面观察仍然不足。文中研究的动机是填补这一知识空白，通过调查矮星系的星系质量函数（SMF）形状、星系-暗物质关系（SHMR）和猝灭分数来更好地理解矮星系形成和演化的环境效应。

Method: 研究使用了SAGA巡天在$z<0.05$范围内的背景星系样本，通过三种指标：环境下的SMF、通过丰度匹配推断的SHMR，以及高度孤立矮星系的猝灭分数，来调查矮星系人口。这些指标用于分析矮星系的环境依赖性，并与大箱体的宇宙学模拟进行比较。

Result: 研究发现低质量SMF形状对环境依赖性很小，场矮星系SMF由低质量幂律指数$m 	extalpha_1=-1.44\pm0.09$描述，降至$m M_	extstar \acksim 5\times10^6 M_	extodot$。孤立矮星系的猝灭分数在$m M_	extstar \acksim 10^{8.5} M_	extodot$时单调下降至$\sim 10^{-3}$。尽管比HI动力学测量稍陡， inferred SHMR与文献中的卫星系统测量一致。然而，大箱体模拟在特定质量范围内高估了孤立星系的猝灭分数。

Conclusion: 虽然大多数当代宇宙学模拟准确预测了SAGA本地的SHMR，但大箱体的模拟在特定质量范围内错误地高估了孤立星系的猝灭分数。这突显了解耦星系形成驱动因素的复杂性，以及在不同环境中系统多维观测矮星系人口的必要性。此外，研究指出需要进一步的观测和模拟工作来更好地理解矮星系的形成和演化机制。

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended our view of the number and properties of
satellite galaxies beyond the Local Group firmly down to $\rm M_\star\sim 10^6
M_\odot$. A similarly complete view of the field dwarf population has lagged
behind. Using the background galaxies sample from the Satellites Around
Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey at $z<0.05$, we take inventory of the dwarf
population down to $\rm M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$ using three metrics:
the stellar mass function (SMF) as function of environment, the stellar-to-halo
mass relation (SHMR) of dwarf galaxies inferred via abundance matching, and the
quenched fraction of highly isolated dwarfs. We find that the low-mass SMF
shape shows minimal environmental dependence, with the field dwarf SMF
described by a low-mass power-law index of $\alpha_1=-1.44\pm0.09$ down to $\rm
M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$, and that the quenched fraction of isolated
dwarfs drops monotonically to $f_{q} \sim 10^{-3}$ at $\rm M_\star \sim \rm
10^{8.5} M_\odot$. Though slightly steeper than estimates from \HI{} kinematic
measures, our inferred SHMR agrees with literature measurements of satellite
systems, consistent with minimal environmental dependence of the SHMR in the
probed mass range. Finally, although most contemporary cosmological simulations
against which we compare accurately predict the \sagalocal{} SHMR, we find that
big-box cosmological simulations largely over-predict isolated galaxy quenched
fractions via a turnaround in $f_q(\rm M_\star)$ at $\rm 10^8\lesssim
M_\star/M_\odot\lesssim 10^9$, underscoring the complexities in disentangling
the drivers of galaxy formation and the need for systematic multidimensional
observations of the dwarf population across environments.

Abstract: We present measurements of stellar population properties of a newly
discovered spectroscopically confirmed $z=11.10^{+0.11}_{-0.26}$,
gravitationally lensed galaxy, using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy and NIRCam
imaging. The arc is highly magnified by the Bullet Cluster (magnification
factor ${\mu}=14.0^{+6.2}_{-0.3}$. It contains three star-forming components of
which one is barely resolved and two are unresolved, giving intrinsic sizes of
$\lesssim 10pc$. The clumps also contain ~50% of the total stellar mass. The
galaxy formed the majority of its stars ~150Myr ago (by z~14). The spectrum
shows a pronounced damping wing, typical for galaxies deep in the reionisation
era and indicating a neutral IGM at this line of sight. The intrinsic
luminosity of the galaxy is $0.086^{+0.008}_{-0.030} L^*$ (with $L^*$ being the
characteristic luminosity for this redshift), making it the lowest luminosity
spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at $z>10$ discovered to date.

Abstract: JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early
Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these
populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies
surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the
strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the
[OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components
and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of
ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5<z<7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred
BH masses from the broad H$\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime
down to $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a
galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down
to $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\lesssim 0.1\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical
$M_{\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the
black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While
we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\rm
BH}\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\sim
10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the
extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models
suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the
direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse
of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive
BHs.

Method: 结合分析相关时间尺度的恒星动力学和最近关于密集恒星系统演化的数值结果来研究不同演化情景。

Result: 在大多数研究的系统中，通过失控碰撞形成大质量黑洞似乎是不可避免的。

Conclusion: Little Red Dots是已知最可能找到新形成的大质量黑洞种子或正在形成中的地方，很可能直接形成超大质量范围的大质量黑洞。

Abstract: We study the stability and possible fates of Little Red Dots, under the
stellar-only interpretation of their observational features. This is performed
by a combination of analyzing the relevant timescales in their stellar dynamics
and also, the application of recent numerical results on the evolution of the
densest stellar systems. We study different scenarios for the evolution of
Little Red Dots and conclude that in a fair fraction of those systems, the
formation of a massive black hole by runaway collisions seems unavoidable, in
all the possibilities studied within the stellar-only interpretation. We
conclude that Little Red Dots are the most favourable known places to find a
recently formed massive black hole seed, or in the process of formation, most
probably formed directly in the supermassive range

Motivation: 研究高红移处的神秘天体'Little Red Dots'（LRDs）以确定其本质，特别是其是否包含过质量黑洞及与AGN活动的关系。

Method: 通过JWST/NIRSpec IFU对UNCOVER_20466进行观测，并结合之前的NIRCam和NIRSpec MSA数据进行分析，利用光谱特征如Balmer减幅和[OIII]4363/Hgamma比值来推断其性质。

Result: 确认UNCOVER_20466包含过质量黑洞，观测到显著的Lyman-alpha辐射逃逸（f_esc,Lya~30%），且[OIII]4363/Hgamma比值极高，表明高密度和AGN活动。

Conclusion: 该天体可能在超密原星系中形成，高电离率和密度特征提供新的见解，需要进一步观测以验证其形成机制和演化过程。

Abstract: Recent photometric surveys with JWST have revealed a significant population
of mysterious objects with red colours, compact morphologies, frequent signs of
active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and negligible X-ray emission. These
'Little Red Dots' (LRDs) have been explored through spectral and photometric
studies, but their nature is still under debate. As part of the BlackTHUNDER
survey, we have observed UNCOVER_20466, the second most distant LRD known
(z=8.5), with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU. Previous JWST/NIRCam and JWST/NIRSpec MSA
observations of this source revealed its LRD nature, as well as the presence of
an AGN. Using our NIRSpec IFU data, we confirm that UNCOVER_20466 contains an
overmassive black hole. However, our observed Balmer decrements imply
negligible dust attenuation, resulting in a much lower Hbeta-based bolometric
luminosity and Eddington luminosity (~10%) than previously found. Lyman-alpha
emission is strongly detected, implying f_esc,Lya~30%. The extremely high
[OIII]4363/Hgamma ratio is indicative of not only AGN photoionization and
heating, but also extremely high densities (ne~10^7cm-3), suggesting that this
black hole at such high redshift may be forming in an ultra-dense protogalaxy.

Abstract: We present the first detection of weak gravitational lensing around
spectroscopically confirmed dwarf galaxies, using the large overlap between
DESI DR1 spectroscopic data and DECADE/DES weak lensing catalogs. A clean dwarf
galaxy sample with well-defined redshift and stellar mass cuts enables excess
surface mass density measurements in two stellar mass bins ($\log
\rm{M}_*=[8.2, 9.2]~M_\odot$ and $\log \rm{M}_*=[9.2, 10.2]~M_\odot$), with
signal-to-noise ratios of $5.6$ and $12.4$ respectively. This signal-to-noise
drops to $4.5$ and $9.2$ respectively for measurements without applying
individual inverse probability (IIP) weights, which mitigates fiber
incompleteness from DESI's targeting. The measurements are robust against
variations in stellar mass estimates, photometric shredding, and lensing
calibration systematics. Using a simulation-based modeling framework with
stellar mass function priors, we constrain the stellar mass-halo mass relation
and find a satellite fraction of $\simeq 0.3$, which is higher than previous
photometric studies but $1.5\sigma$ lower than $\Lambda$CDM predictions. We
find that IIP weights have a significant impact on lensing measurements and can
change the inferred $f_{\rm{sat}}$ by a factor of two, highlighting the need
for accurate fiber incompleteness corrections for dwarf galaxy samples. Our
results open a new observational window into the galaxy-halo connection at low
masses, showing that future massively multiplexed spectroscopic observations
and weak lensing data will enable stringent tests of galaxy formation models
and $\Lambda$CDM predictions.

Abstract: We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole
(SMBH) mass in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4258, a critical benchmark for
extragalactic mass measurements. We use archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU data
(G235H/F170LP grating) to extract high-resolution two-dimensional stellar
kinematics from the CO bandhead absorption features within the central $3''
\times 3''$. We extract the stellar kinematics after correcting for
instrumental artifacts and separating the stellar light from the non-thermal
AGN continuum. We employ Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM) to fit the observed
kinematics, exploring a grid of 12 models to systematically test the impact of
different assumptions for the point-spread function, stellar mass-to-light
ratio ($M/L$) profile, and orbital anisotropy. All 12 models provide broadly
acceptable fits, albeit with minor differences. The ensemble median and 68%
(1$\sigma$) bootstrap confidence intervals of our 12 models yield a black hole
mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (4.08^{+0.19}_{-0.33}) \times 10^7$ M$_\odot$. This paper
showcases the utility of using the full model ensemble to robustly account for
systematic uncertainties, rather than relying on formal errors from a single
preferred model, as has been common practice. Our result is just 5% larger
than, and consistent with, the benchmark SMBH mass derived from water maser
dynamics, validating the use of NIRSpec stellar kinematics for robust SMBH mass
determination. Our analysis demonstrates JWST's capability to resolve the
SMBH's sphere of influence and deliver precise dynamical masses, even in the
presence of significant AGN continuum emission.

Abstract: Contamination-free assessments of the interstellar medium and star formation
in quasar host galaxies, particularly based on the far-infrared, offer insights
into the role of supermassive black holes in galaxy evolution. Motivated by
predictions of quasar heating of dust on both nuclear and galaxy-wide scales,
we perform two-component (host galaxy + point source) modeling of
high-resolution (~0.1") ALMA observations of the FIR continuum in Band 5
(lambda_rest~500 um) of three highly luminous quasars (L_bol~10^47 erg/s),
powered by supermassive black holes having M_BH~10^9 M_sun, at z=2. We include
Band 9 (lambda_rest~154 um; 0.06" and 0.3") data at high S/N which places
further constraints on the unresolved nuclear component in two cases. To break
the degeneracy between quasar and stellar heating, we use CO (J=5-4), observed
in Band 5, to gauge the expected contribution of star formation to the infrared
luminosity. We find very good agreement between the strength and spatial
distribution of the extended continuum component and its prediction based on CO
(J=5-4). This is supported by the location of our three quasars along the L_(CO
5-4)-L_(IR, SFR) luminosity relation for inactive star-forming galaxies. As a
consequence, there is no evidence for additional continuum emission on extended
scales which could be attributed to quasar-heated dust. As expected, the
nuclear (i.e., torus) contribution is present and subdominant (12% in Band 9
for one quasar with a typical star-forming host) or non-existent (<8% in Band 9
for the starbursting host). Based on the continuum and CO, the presence of
substantial levels of ongoing star formation agrees with previous estimates
from unresolved ALMA continuum observations which finds SFRs consistent with
star-forming main-sequence galaxies. Therefore, our results do not provide
evidence for a quasar-mode feedback, even for the most luminous cases at z=2.

TL;DR: The paper presents deep Chandra X-ray observations of NGC 5005, revealing a low-luminosity AGN with a thin accretion disk despite an extremely low Eddington ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the nature of NGC 5005's X-ray emission and its potential host AGN, considering previous reports of broad Hα emission lines.

Method: Deep Chandra X-ray observations combined with Hubble Space Telescope narrow-band imaging and excitation maps, along with data from NuSTAR and Swift for X-ray luminosity constraints.

Result: Diffuse soft X-ray emission extends out to ~800 pc, harder emission is confined to the central ~400 pc. Spatially resolved spectroscopy indicates photoionized and thermal plasma components. Detection of a faint hard X-ray nuclear source with consistency with HST [O III]λ5007 emission.

Conclusion: NGC 5005 hosts an intrinsically low-luminosity, unobscured AGN with a thin accretion disk, challenging standard accretion flow models at low Eddington ratios.

Abstract: We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of NGC 5005, a LINER-dominated
galaxy previously reported to host a broad H$\alpha$ emission line. The diffuse
soft X-ray emission ($<$3 keV) extends out to $\sim$800 pc, while harder
emission ($>$3 keV) is confined to the central $\sim$400 pc. Spatially resolved
spectroscopy of the nuclear ($r<150$ pc) and extended ($150<r<500$ pc) regions
reveals that these are best described by models including both photoionized and
thermal plasma components, consistent with excitation by a low-luminosity AGN
and shock-heated gas. Narrow-band imaging and excitation maps from the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) support this interpretation, closely matching the X-ray
morphology and ionization structure. The detection of a faint hard X-ray
nuclear source with Chandra, combined with stringent upper limits from NuSTAR
and Swift, and consistency with the X-ray luminosity predicted from the HST [O
III]$\lambda$5007 emission, indicates that NGC 5005 hosts an intrinsically
low-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol} \sim 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$), unobscured AGN.
Despite the extremely low Eddington ratio inferred from our measurements
($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim 5 \times 10^{-6}$), the presence of a broad H$\alpha$
line in the optical spectrum suggests the persistence of a thin accretion disk,
challenging standard paradigms of accretion flow configurations at such low
accretion rates.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: This paper studies the triple-AGN candidate SDSS J0849+1114, discovering extended ionized gas structures and two distinct outflows, indicating past high accretion rates and episodic AGN feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of AGN feedback in galaxy evolution, particularly during mergers that influence starbursts and SMBH accretion.

Method: Using VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy for spatially resolved analysis of SDSS J0849+1114.

Result: Extended ionized gas structures associated with tidal tails and two ionized gas outflows detected; one around nucleus A with higher kinetic power, possibly driven by a radio jet, and another around nucleus C with lower kinetic power. High [O III]/Hα and [N II]/Hα ratios in tidal gas suggest past high accretion rates in nucleus A.

Conclusion: The triple AGN system demonstrates episodic AGN feedback that expelled gas and quenched accretion, showing how AGN can self-regulate black hole growth and affect host galaxies during mergers.

Abstract: Galaxy mergers funnel gas toward the nuclei, igniting starbursts and active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). The AGN feedback can reshape the host galaxy and
regulate both star formation and super-massive black-hole (SMBH) accretion.
Using VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy, we conduct a spatially resolved
study of the triple-AGN candidate SDSS J0849+1114. Extended ionized gas
structures ($>10$ kpc from nucleus A) primarily associated with tidal tails are
detected. Meanwhile, two distinct ionized gas outflows are revealed. One
extends over $>5$ kpc around nuclei A with a kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm
out,A} = 3.0\times10^{42}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$, which might be driven by the
radio jet. The other outflow extends $\sim 5.9$ kpc around nucleus C, with a
kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm out,C} = 2.0\times10^{40}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$.
High [O III]/H$\alpha$ and [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratios in the tidal gas require
that nucleus A radiated at a high accretion rate with $L_{\rm A,bol} \sim
0.1$--$0.5\,L_{\rm Edd,A}$ at least $\sim3$--$\times10^{4}\rm\,yr$ ago,
$20$--$100$ times brighter than today. Combined with multi-wavelength
constraints, we find evidence for episodic AGN feedback that expelled
circumnuclear gas and rapidly quenched accretion. This triple AGN candidate
demonstrates how AGN feedback can self-regulate black hole growth and impact
hosts during mergers.

Method: 使用阿塔卡马大型毫米/次毫米波阵列(ALMA)对12个SMGs在870微米波段进行连续观测，以获得亚千秒尺度的图像。

Result: 发现了多种形态特性，包括一个在红移z=2.5处可能由与次要伴星系的潮汐相互作用引起的双臂螺旋星系，以及大约一半样本表现出的紧凑圆形形态，类似于光学形态的静止星系。

Abstract: High-resolution far-infrared (FIR) observation of submillimeter galaxies
(SMGs) is an effective approach to study the formation of sub-structures in the
early epoch of massive galaxies. We present the 870$\mu$m continuum images
resolved down to sub-kpc scales for 12 SMGs taken by Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) as an initial sample of the FOSSILS
Survey. We discovered a wide variety of morphological properties, including a
two-arm spiral galaxy at $z=2.5$ possibly induced by a tidal interaction with a
minor companion. Nonetheless, about half of the sample exhibit a compact and
circular morphology, which is reminiscent of optical morphology of compact
quiescent galaxies. Future studies with larger sample and combination of the
rest-frame optical images taken by James Webb Space Telescope will shed light
on the various evolutionary track of SMGs.

*Aman Khalid,Sarah Brough,Garreth Martin,Lucas C. Kimmig,Rhea-Silvia Remus,Claudia del P. Lagos,Lucas M. Valenzuela,Ruby J. Wright*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: This paper studies tidal features around satellite galaxies in different environments using mock data from simulations to show that tidal features decrease in central cluster regions due to higher velocities and lower masses, with a survival time of ~3 Gyr.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how dense environments affect merger likelihood and tidal features, particularly the role of relative velocities and galaxy mass in satellite galaxies' merger histories.

Method: The researchers used mock observations from the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Magneticum Pathfinder simulations to analyze tidal features in the velocity-radius projected phase-space diagram across group and cluster environments.

Result: Ancient infallers in dense environments show lower tidal features with increasing halo mass, while recent infallers have stable tidal feature fractions. Tidal features are suppressed in central cluster regions, indicating reduced merger rates.

Conclusion: The study finds that tidal features in galaxy clusters are suppressed in central areas due to high velocities and low masses, with a survival time of ~3 Gyr. This suggests that tidal features are more common in recent infaller regions and dissipate over time.

Abstract: Generally, merger likelihood increases in denser environments; however, the
large relative velocities at the centres of dense clusters are expected to
reduce the likelihood of mergers for satellite galaxies. Tidal features probe
the recent merger histories of galaxies. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce an unprecedented sample of tidal
features around millions of galaxies. We use LSST-like mock observations of
galaxies at $z\sim0$ from the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG and Magneticum Pathfinder
cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations to predict the occurrence rates of
tidal features around satellite galaxies across group and cluster environments
in the velocity-radius projected phase-space diagram to investigate the impact
of these environments on tidal feature occurrence. We find that ancient
infallers in the projected phase-space exhibit a decreasing tidal feature
fraction with increasing halo mass, whereas recent infallers in the projected
phase-space show unchanging tidal feature fractions with halo mass. Our results
show, for the first time in cosmological simulations, a suppression of tidal
feature fractions in the central regions of galaxy clusters, indicating a
reduced merger rate due to higher cluster-centric velocities and lower galaxy
total masses in the cluster centres. Using a toy model, we show that the
presence of more tidal features in the recent infaller zone and cluster
outskirts suggests that tidal features occur in interactions within infalling
groups and dissipate by the time they are ancient infallers, indicating a
$\lesssim3\pm2$ Gyr survival time of tidal features within clusters.

Result: 发现了一个跨越8 kpc的分子尾迹，显示出超音速湍流和极高的长宽比，暗示近期的相互作用事件。

Conclusion: 这一发现证明了银河系尺度的尾迹可以作为探测大质量暗天体与星系盘相互作用的工具。

Abstract: We report the discovery of a kpc scale molecular contrail in the spiral
galaxy NGC 3627, a narrow structure spanning 8 kpc in length with a width of
200 pc and an extreme aspect ratio of 40, observed in both mid-infrared dust
emission (PHANGS-JWST) and CO(2-1) gas (PHANGS-ALMA). This contrail size
significantly exceeds the size of any known analogs in the Milky Way and
exhibits supersonic turbulence (10 km/s). Its morphology and dynamics are
consistent with gravitational focusing by a flyby compact object of mass 1e6
M_sun, likely a massive black hole or a dwarf galaxy nucleus, traversing the
disk at >300 km/s. The crossing time of such a contrail, estimated from its
width and velocity dispersion, is only $\sim 20$ Myr, implying a recent
interaction. This contrail can be caused by a dwarf galaxy, or massive black
hole nucleus. This discovery establishes galactic-scale contrails as probes of
massive dark objects interacting with medium in and around galactic disks.

Motivation: 探讨Ursa Minor矮星系的结构复杂性和动力学历史，同时识别可能的潮汐特征或其他机制形成的延伸星系结构。

Method: 利用Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam的深而广的数据，绘制主序星的颜色-星等图，沿七个方位角方向导出径向数密度剖面，并使用指数+幂律函数拟合以评估延伸成分的对称性。

Result: 沿次轴的主序星数量密度高于主轴，幂律斜率在次轴方向较浅，但对称性在1σ不确定度范围内仍不明确。

Conclusion: 延伸成分可能优先分布于次轴，表明该区域的结构可能与之前推测的主要轴潮汐特征不同。同时，合并机制与其他机制（如恒星或超新星反馈）均可能解释这一现象。

Abstract: We discover an extended distribution of main-sequence (MS) stars along the
minor axis of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). This study
is enabled by deep, wide Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam data, reaching photometric
uncertainties below 0.1 mag at $g,i \sim 26$ mag. Color-magnitude diagrams
along the major and minor axes reveal a clear excess of MS stars beyond the
nominal tidal radius along the minor axis. To characterize this structure, we
derive radial number density profiles in seven azimuthal directions and fit
them with an exponential+power-law function to assess the symmetry of the
extended component. The power-law slopes tend to be shallower toward the minor
axis, though the symmetry remains inconclusive within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties.
This may indicate that the extended component is preferentially distributed
along the minor axis, and could be different from the previously suggested
tidal features along the major axis. Comparing with simulations, we find that
the fraction of stars beyond five effective radii is consistent with
expectations from an intermediate mass ratio merger scenario with a stellar
mass ratio around 6:1. While these findings provide new insights into the
structural complexity and dynamical history of the UMi dSph, alternative
mechanisms such as stellar or supernova feedback have also been proposed for
extended stellar halos in dwarfs and cannot be ruled out.

Motivation: 由于缺乏对这些分子在低温下的光谱信息，难以全面检测和理解它们在星际介质（ISM）和太阳系中的存在和重要性。因此，研究团队希望通过实验获取这些数据。

Method: 通过在冷尘埃模拟物上形成冰层，对纯分子冰中的异戊二烯以及一些简单的萜烯（柠檬烯、α-蒎烯和β-蒎烯）进行真空紫外（VUV）光吸收测量。

Result: 首次报告了异戊二烯及其低聚物、柠檬烯、α-蒎烯和β-蒎烯在10 K低温下的VUV光谱。所有分子的光谱在冰相和气相中表现出相似性，除了异戊二烯，其冰相吸收有显著的红移。

Conclusion: 异戊二烯的独特性质及其在冰相中的长波长吸收特征，支持其在冰体上的检测。这有助于更好地理解这些分子在星际介质和太阳系中的存在和作用。

Abstract: Isoprene and its oligomers, terpenes, are expected to be present, along with
other complex organic molecules, in the diverse environments of the ISM and in
our solar system. Due to insufficient spectral information of these molecules
at low temperature, the detection and understanding of the importance of these
molecules has been rather incomplete. For this purpose, we have carried out the
vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoabsorption measurements on pure molecular ices of
isoprene and a few simple terpenes: limonene, $\alpha$-pinene and
$\beta$-pinene by forming icy mantles on cold dust analogs. From these
experiments, we report the first low-temperature (10 K) VUV spectra of isoprene
and its oligomers, limonene, $\alpha$-pinene, and $\beta$-pinene. VUV
photoabsorption spectra of all the molecules reported here reveal similarities
in the ice and gas phase, as expected, except for isoprene, where a prominent
red shift is observed in the ice phase absorption. This unique property of
isoprene, along with distinctive absorption at longer wavelengths, supports its
candidature for detection on icy bodies.

Abstract: Currently, the number of galaxy clusters identified using galaxy data has far

used positional information from large optical cluster catalogues to search for
previously unrecognized X-ray galaxy clusters in archival XMM-Newton data. We
successfully identified 1490 galaxy clusters in X-ray images for the first
time. By incorporating 1913 previously known X-ray clusters, we constructed a
sample of 3403 galaxy clusters observed by XMM-Newton. Our cluster mass
estimates show broad consistency with previous measurements. Comparative
analyses between the known and newly identified subsamples revealed that new
X-ray clusters exhibit systematically higher redshifts, lower masses, and
smaller X-ray-to-optical mass ratios, but show no systematic differences in
dynamical properties. The newly identified X-ray clusters are a valuable
addition to previous X-ray samples and are important for future statistical
studies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Prestellar cores represent the initial conditions of star formation, but
heavy molecules such as CO are strongly depleted in their cold, dense
interiors, limiting the ability to probe core centers. Deuterated molecular
ions therefore emerge as key tracers because deuterium fractionation is
enhanced at low temperatures. We present the first direct observation of
ortho-H2D+ depletion in the prestellar core G205.46-14.56M3 using ALMA 820um
continuum and ortho-H2D+(110-111) data at ~300-au resolution. We confirm the
previously reported two substructures, B1 and B2, and identify a central
ortho-H2D+ depletion zone toward B1 with ~6$\sigma$ contrast and an inferred
diameter $\lesssim$600au, together with a peak
$x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+)=$1.03^{+0.07}_{-0.56}$. The observationally inferred
profiles of $x$(ortho-H2D+) and $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+) are reproduced by a
deuteration-focused chemo-dynamical model; however, the central ortho-H2D+
depletion is only marginally matched within the $2\sigma$ upper limit, likely
suggesting additional deuteration in the depletion zone. From these models we
infer a core age of ~0.42Ma, comparable to the free-fall time, suggesting that
the substructures formed via rapid, turbulence-dominated fragmentation rather
than slow, quasi-static contraction. Our observations also reveal that
ortho-H2D+ velocity dispersions are largely subsonic in the core and nearly
thermal between B1 and B2, consistent with turbulence dissipating within a few
free-fall times. These results highlight the critical role of deuterated ions
for both chemical evolution and dynamics in dense cores.

Abstract: This paper is the second in a series presenting \textsc{RadioSED}, a Bayesian
inference framework for constructing, modelling and classifying radio spectral
energy distributions from publicly-available surveys. We focus here on the
application of our framework to SDSS Stripe 82. Not only do we recover all
eleven previously-published peaked spectrum sources from the literature within
this region, but we increase the number of known peaked spectrum sources here
by more than an order of magnitude. We investigate the variability properties
of our peaked spectrum sample, and find that overall they exhibit a low degree
of variability, consistent with previous samples of peaked spectrum active
galactic nuclei. The multiwavelength properties of these sources reveal that we
have selected a population comprising largely distant ($z \geq 1$), powerful
active galaxies. We find that the most compact jets are located preferentially
in quasar-type hosts, with galaxy-type hosts home to slightly more extended
radio structures. We discuss these findings in the context of current and
forthcoming large area radio surveys.

Motivation: 由于LRDs在多波段性质上的冲突，研究者试图通过模拟和观测数据来评估常用形态分析工具的可靠性，以正确解释这些天体的形态特征。

Method: 利用pysersic和GALFIT对模拟的LRDs进行参数恢复，并对观测数据进行Sersic和双成分拟合，比较结果与模拟样本。

Result: 低信噪比（$	ext{SNR} \< 25$）下工具难以恢复参数；PSF分数可更稳健地描述紧凑性；几乎所有低SNR（$	ext{SNR} \< 50$）的LRDs无法与点源区分；约85%观测LRDs为PSF主导，其余15%有较低PSF分数和较大尺寸。

Conclusion: LRDs的形态多样性表明其非同质性，可能包含AGN主导的主类和紧凑星暴的次类，这对理解其本质和演化具有重要意义。

Abstract: Early results from JWST uncover a peculiar class of objects referred to as
``little red dots'' (LRDs). The extremely compact morphology of LRDs is often
invoked to point towards an AGN-dominated picture in the context of their
conflicting multiwavelength properties. In this work, we assess the capability
of pysersic and GALFIT -- commonly used tools in LRD morphological studies --
to recover input parameters for a simulated suite of LRD-like objects in the
F444W band. We find that: 1) these tools have difficulty recovering input
parameters for simulated images with SNR $\lesssim 25$; 2) estimated PSF
fraction could be a more robust physically-motivated description of LRD
compactness; and 3) almost all permutations of modeled LRDs with SNR $\lesssim
50$ cannot be differentiated from a point source, regardless of intrinsic
extent. This has serious implications on how we interpret morphological results
for increasingly large photometric samples of LRDs, especially at extremely
high-$z$ or in relatively shallow fields. We present results of Sersic and
two-component fitting to a sample of observed LRDs to compare with our mock
sample fitting. We find that $\sim85\%$ of observed LRDs are PSF-dominated,
consistent with the AGN-dominated interpretation. The remaining $\sim15\%$ have
low estimated PSF fractions (two-component fit) and sizes $\gtrsim 150$ pc
(Sersic). This morphological diversity of LRDs suggests that that the
population likely is not homogeneous. It possibly has a primary subset of
sources consistent with the AGN-dominated hypothesis, and a secondary
population of sources more consistent with arising perhaps from extremely
compact starbursts.

Abstract: Hydrodynamic simulations can connect outflow observables to the physical
conditions of outflowing gas. Here, we use simulations of isolated disk
galaxies ranging from dwarf mass ($M_{200} = 10^{10}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) to
Milky Way mass ($M_{200} = 10^{12}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), based on the FIRE-2
subgrid models to investigate multiphase galactic outflows. We use the CHIMES
non-equilibrium chemistry module to create synthetic spectra of common outflow
tracers ([CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$, $\mathrm{CO}_{J(1-0)}$, H$\alpha$ and
$[\mathrm{OIII}]_{5007\text{A}}$). Using our synthetic spectra we measure the
mass outflow rate, kinetic power and momentum flux using observational
techniques. In [CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$ we measure outflow rates of $10^{-4}$ to
$1$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ across an SFR range of $10^{-3}$ to $1$
$\text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is in reasonable agreement with
observations. The significant discrepancy is in $\mathrm{CO}_{J(1-0)}$, with
the simulations lying $\approx1$ dex below the observational sample. We test
observational assumptions used to derive outflow properties from synthetic
spectra. We find the greatest uncertainty lies in measurements of electron
density, as estimates using the SII doublet can overestimate the actual
electron density by up to 2 dex, which changes mass outflow rates by up to 4
dex. We also find that molecular outflows are especially sensitive to the
conversion factor between CO luminosity and H2 mass, with outflow rates
changing by up to 4 dex in our least massive galaxy. Comparing the outflow
properties derived from the synthetic spectra to those derived directly from
the simulation, we find that [CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$ probes outflows at greater
distances from the disk, whilst we find that molecular gas does not survive at
large distances within outflows within our modestly star-forming disk galaxies
simulated in this work.

of lensing plasma medium is related to the frequency-independent image
position; however, our analysis demonstrates that both the image position
($\theta(\nu)$) and dispersion measure (DM$(\nu)$) are inherently
frequency-dependent when signals traverse a structured plasma medium.
  We have been able to resolve this paradox by developing a framework that
explicitly incorporates frequency-dependent dispersion measures (DMs) following
power-law relationships ($\rm DM\propto \nu^\gamma$). Our analysis shows that
the signal magnification decreases systematically with decreasing frequency,
offering a plausible explanation for the frequency-dependent peak flux
densities observed in fast radio bursts (FRBs), particularly in the case of the
repeating FRB 180814.J0422+73. Our results suggest these FRBs could originate
from the magnetized compact star magnetospheres. By considering these
plasma-lensing effects on the sub-pulses of an FRB across different
frequencies, we have the ability to more accurately investigate the intrinsic
properties of FRBs via precise measurements of radio signals.

Abstract: Galactic PeVatrons are astrophysical sources accelerating particles up to a
few PeV (~10$^{15}$ eV). The primary method to identify both electron and
proton PeVatrons is the observation of $\gamma$-ray radiation at ultra-high
energies (UHE; E$>$100 TeV). In 2021, LHAASO detected 14 steady $\gamma$-ray
sources with photon energies above 100 TeV and up to 1.4 PeV. Most of these
sources can be plausibly associated with objects such as supernova remnants,
pulsar wind nebulae, and stellar clusters. However, LHAASO J0341$+$5258 is
detected as an unidentified PeVatron, emitting $\gamma$ rays at energies above
hundreds of TeV. It is extended in nature and notably bright, with a flux $>$
20% of the Crab Nebula's flux above 25 TeV. Multiwavelength observations are
required to identify the PeVatron responsible for the UHE $\gamma$ rays,
understand the source morphology and association, and shed light on the
emission processes. Here, we will present the results from the VERITAS and HAWC
observations of this PeVatron, along with a discussion on potential emission
scenarios through multiwavelength modeling.

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that couple
to photons, are among the most actively investigated candidates for new physics
beyond the Standard Model. Their interaction with gamma rays in the presence of
astrophysical magnetic fields can leave characteristic, energy-dependent
modulations in observed spectra. Capturing such subtle features requires
precise statistical inference, but standard likelihood-based methods often fall
short when faced with complex models, large number of nuisance parameters and
limited analytical tractability. In this work, we investigate the application
of simulation-based inference (SBI), specifically Truncated Marginal Neural
Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), to constrain ALP parameters using simulated
observations from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We
model the gamma-ray emission from the active galactic nucleus NGC 1275,
accounting for photon-ALP mixing, extragalactic background light (EBL)
absorption, and the full CTAO instrument response. Leveraging the Swyft
framework, we infer posteriors for the ALP mass and coupling strength and
demonstrate its potential to extract meaningful constraints on ALPs from future
real gamma-ray data with CTAO.

TL;DR: 研究人员重新分析了1993J超新星爆发后约1700天的演化过程，采用一种新的VLBI分析技术，以更高的角分辨率揭示了膨胀壳状喷射物结构，并首次测量了爆炸后264天的喷射物宽度。

Motivation: 为了更精确地理解超新星喷射物的演化动力学，并且检测更先进的爆炸和相互作用机制模拟。

Method: 使用新的VLBI分析技术，结合闭合量分析，提供与校准无关的约束条件，比较不同方法间的结果。

Result: 发现在175至1693天期间，喷射物膨胀遵循幂律指数ω=0.80±0.01，且在爆炸后早期（t<1000天）喷射物宽度无显著变化，平均分数宽度为0.24±0.04（相对于半径）。

Conclusion: 这些新的约束条件为测试更先进的爆炸和相互作用机制模拟提供了途径，且新方法在角分辨率和对喷射物结构的刻画方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: SN 1993J is the best-studied radio supernova, with observations using
very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) spanning from within weeks of
explosion through nearly three decades of ejecta evolution. Imaging and
modeling techniques have revealed an expanding shell-like ejecta structure,
with a width well-constrained after ~1000 days. In this work, we present a
re-analysis of the first ~1700 days of SN 1993J evolution, using a new VLBI
analysis technique with somewhat intrinsically higher angular resolution and
compare our results with those from previous conventional techniques. We adopt
the m-ring model, with potentially somewhat higher angular resolution, but only
as a phenomenological alternative to the physically-motivated spherical shell
model used in past analyses and shape the profile to approximately match that
of the shell. We use closure quantities only, providing calibration insensitive
constraints on ejecta geometry and largely independent comparisons with
previous results from the same data sets. Using this approach we find the
ejecta expanding with a power-law exponent $\omega=0.80\pm0.01$ averaged for
the time from 175 to 1693 days, consistent with shell-fitting analyses. For the
first time, we report estimates of the ejecta width at t < 1000 days -- as
early as 264 days post-explosion -- finding a mean fractional width with
standard deviation of $0.24 \pm 0.04$ (of the radius) with no significant
evolution. We present a fit of the azimuthal brightness modulation over time
with the maximum of a horseshoe pattern rotating from east to south-southwest
from 175 to 1000 d and then evolving to a more complex behavior, quantifying
previous results from images only. The constraints on the angular brightness
modulation and width over time and ~700 days earlier than existing analyses
provide an avenue to test more advanced simulations of the explosion and
interaction mechanisms.

Result: 发现两颗脉冲星PSR J1646$-$4451和PSR J1837$-$0616，它们的散射时间尺度分别为2479 ms和2154 ms在1 GHz频率下，属于已知最严重散射的脉冲星之一。

Conclusion: 研究结论强调了使用圆偏振技术来识别高度散射脉冲星的潜力，并指出未来的宽视场无线电连续谱调查将有助于发现更多极端脉冲星，如在1.4 GHz下严重散射、固有微弱或位于双星系统中的脉冲星，从而为脉冲星人口统计和星际介质的复杂结构提供宝贵见解。

Abstract: We report the discovery and timing of two pulsars from a sample of four
circularly polarized sources identified in radio continuum images taken as part
of the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) Variables and Slow Transients (VAST)
survey. Observations with the Parkes (Murriyang) radio telescope confirmed both
sources as normal pulsars with high dispersion measures. PSR J1646$-$4451 has a
spin period of 217 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 928 $\rm cm^{-3} \, pc$,
while PSR J1837$-$0616 exhibits a spin period of 118 ms and a DM of 793 $\rm
cm^{-3} \, pc$. These pulsars show extreme pulse broadening due to scattering,
with measured scattering timescales of 290 ms and 343 ms at observing
frequencies of 1.8 GHz and 1.9 GHz, respectively. These measurements imply
extrapolated scattering timescales at 1 GHz of 2479 ms and 2154 ms, placing
them among the most heavily scattered pulsars known to date. Our findings
underscore the potential of using circular polarization in radio continuum
images as a tool for identifying highly scattered pulsars. Future wide-field
radio continuum surveys are poised to uncover a broader population of extreme
pulsars particularly those that are heavily scattered at 1.4 GHz, intrinsically
faint, or residing in binaries$-$offering valuable insights into both pulsar
demographics and the complex structure of the interstellar medium.

Abstract: We report on the follow-up observations of circularly polarized sources
identified in the MeerKAT image-based survey of the Galactic bulge. Using the
Parkes radio telescope, we observed sixteen circularly polarized sources with
the UWL receiver and detected nine pulsars among which six of them are new
discoveries. All pulsars are fast rotators with spin periods under 100\,ms.
Among the new discoveries five are millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and one has a
spin period of 55\,ms. At least four new MSPs exhibit clear signs of binary
motion in their discovery observations. The dispersion measures (DMs) of these
pulsars fall between 18 and 330\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$, which is lower than expected
for Galactic bulge members and indicates that these pulsars lie in the
foreground along the line of sight rather than within the bulge itself. This is
the first time such a large number of pulsars have been confirmed via an
image-based survey. These discoveries underscore the exceptional efficacy of
circular polarization selection in image-based pulsar surveys, and demonstrate
the powerful synergy between high-sensitivity imaging and targeted time-domain
follow-up using wide-band receivers and strengthen prospects for future deep
pulsation searches$-$e.g., with MeerKAT or the forthcoming SKA or DSA-2000$-$to
uncover the true millisecond pulsar population in the Galactic bulge.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most frequently observed outcome of
core-collapse explosions and provide a valuable window into the physical
mechanisms governing the deaths of massive stars. However, estimates of
explosion properties based on optical light curve modeling often show tension
with the predictions of modern neutrino-driven explosion models. In particular,
when based on light curves from the explosions of red supergiant (RSG) tied to
specific stellar wind models, many SNe II are found to originate from low-mass
progenitors yet exhibit unusually high explosion energies ($E_{\rm K}$), far
exceeding theoretical predictions. In this study, we incorporate late-phase
(nebular) spectroscopy to estimate the helium core mass of the progenitor
($M_{\rm He\,core}$), which serves as an additional constraint to break
degeneracies in light curve modeling. This approach is applied to a sample of
32 well-observed SNe II, using a light curve model grid constructed from RSGs
with arbitrarily stripped hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than assuming a fixed
wind model. Examining the resulting correlations among the physical parameters,
we find that the tension between the observed $M_{\rm He\,core}$-$E_{\rm K}$
and $E_{\rm K}$-$M_{\rm Ni}$ relations and those predicted by neutrino-driven
explosion models has significantly lessened by incorporating nebular
spectroscopy in light curve modeling. This study highlights the crucial role of
nebular spectroscopy in interpreting SNe II observations and provides support
to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism as the dominant engine powering
these events.

Abstract: Large Array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (LACT) is an array of
32 Cherenkov telescopes with 6-meter diameter mirrors to be constructed at the
LHAASO site, aiming to enhance our understanding of ultra-high energy gamma ray
astronomy. This work presents a detailed performance assessment of the LACT
array, focusing on the IRFs for both an 8-telescope subarray configuration
optimized for large zenith angle observations (60{\deg}) and the full
32-telescope array, with a particular emphasis on a 20{\deg} zenith angle
configuration for lower energy threshold observations.
  We have generated IRFs using extensive Monte Carlo simulations of gamma-ray
showers and the detector response. The IRFs include the effective area, angular
resolution, and energy resolution as a function of energy and offset angle.
Crucially, these IRFs are produced in the standard Data format for Gamma ray
astronomy (GADF), ensuring interoperability with existing analysis tools like
Gammapy and ctools and enabling seamless integration into scientific workflows.
  In this work, we also have used these GADF-format IRFs to simulate
observations towards the Galactic Center Region.

Abstract: The emissivity profile assumed in X-ray reflection spectroscopy significantly
impacts black hole spin measurements. Using simulated NuSTAR spectra generated
for lamppost and disk-like coronae with the relxill model suite, we evaluate
systematic biases introduced when fitting with power-law or broken power-law
emissivity profiles. We find that a simple power-law can accurately recover
spins for low-height lamppost coronae with long exposures and low inclination
angle, while broken power-laws introduce degeneracies when the simple power-law
already performs adequately. However, for extended or high-height coronae,
especially at high inclinations, both models produce large systematic biases
unresolved by longer exposure times. Our results demonstrate that power-law
approximations are reliable for compact coronae, highlighting the need for
geometry-specific models in complex cases.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose that the high eccentricity of the stellar orbit in Gaia BH3 system
could be excited through a secular resonance effect if the inner dark object
is, in effect, a tight and eccentric black hole binary (BHB). During the
orbital decay of the inner BHB, the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary
matches that of the outer stellar orbit, and this resonance advection can drive
the outer eccentricity into some extreme values. For a Gaia BH3-like system, we
show that a near equal-mass ($q=0.8$) BHB with an initial semi-major axis of
1--3 au and an initial eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.95$ is able to excite the outer
orbit to the observed value, leaving a current BHB with semi-major axis
0.25--0.5 au and eccentricity $\sim 0.8$. The eccentric inner BHB imprints two
observable signatures on the outer star: (1) short-term RV modulations with an
amplitude $\lesssim 100$ m/s and (2) long-term apsidal precession with a rate
$\lesssim 0.1^{\circ}$/yr. Although neither of these is detected in the
currently available astrometry and RV data, we show that these signals are
detectable with the full Gaia astrometry data and dedicated high-precision
and/or long-term RV observations. Our work provides a new perspective on the
dynamical formation of Gaia BH3, and the methodology is readily applicable to
similar systems such as HD 130298, Gaia BH1, and Gaia BH2.

Abstract: Cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere of an astrophysical object produce
showers of secondary particles that may then scape into space. Here we obtain
the flux of gammas and neutrinos of energy $E>10$ GeV emited by the Sun,
Jupiter and Earth. We show that, while the solar magnetic field induces an
albedo flux of gammas from all the points in the Sun's surface, the dipolar
magnetic field in the planets implies gammas only from the very peripheral
region. Neutrinos, in contrast, can cross these objects and emerge from any
point in their surface. The emission from these astrophysical objects is above
the diffuse flux from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium and
has a distinct spectrum and gamma to neutrino ratio.

Abstract: Microquasars are increasingly recognized as efficient particle accelerators,

acceleration mechanisms within the jets and at the jet-medium interaction in

Motivation: X射线脉冲星通常由磁化中子星和光学供体星组成，中子星通过吸积物质产生脉冲X射线辐射。大多数情况下供体星是Be型星，吸积过程是间歇性的，导致中子星通常X射线暗，但偶尔爆发。研究这些X射线爆发的特性有助于理解中子星的演化和高能现象。

Method: 利用X射线监测数据进行统计研究，分析中子星自转周期与爆发参数之间的关系，发现两者之间的强相关性。

Abstract: X-ray pulsars (XRPs) consist of a magnetized neutron star (NS) and an optical
donor star. The NS accretes matter from the donor star producing pulsed X-ray
emission. In most cases the donor stars are Be stars, and accretion is
episodic, that is, the NSs are generally X-ray dim, but occasionally experience
outbursts. Here, we carry out a statistical study with the X-ray monitoring
data, and obtain strong correlations between the spin periods of the NSs and
the outburst parameters for the first time. We show that XRPs containing faster
rotating NSs tend to display more violent eruptions. In addition, pulsating
ultraluminous X-ray sources in nearby galaxies follow the similar relationship.
We demonstrate that most of these systems are close to the spin equilibrium,
and that brighter pulsars have acquired more angular momentum by accreting
matter from their companion stars, resulting in faster rotating NSs.

Abstract: Both the Rubin Observatory and the first telescopes of the CTAO will be
collecting data by 2026, marking a new era in optical and gamma-ray astronomy.
Compared to predecessors, their enhanced sensitivity will extend extragalactic
observations to a redshift of at least 2.5. This advancement offers insights
into non-thermal astrophysical sources, particularly blazars. The 3-night
cadence monitoring with Rubin, in one of its six filters, will produce blazar
light curves that, when combined with targeted in-depth observations from the
CTAO, could help distinguish acceleration and radiative models. Existing data
from the ZTF and Fermi-LAT, though less sensitive, offer insights into what
Rubin and the CTAO may achieve. However, the real-time processing of the
immense data stream coming from Rubin/LSST presents a major challenge.
  Addressing this challenge is the work of brokers such as Fink, which we
develop for multi-messenger astrophysics. Fink processes data in real-time
before sending relevant information to other observatories like the CTAO. In
this contribution, we present how we characterize the optical variability of
blazars that emit in the gamma-ray range using the ZTF, with timescales
spanning from the intra-night to multi-years. We identify properties in the
resulting parameter space that could not only enable the identification of
blazar-like sources, but also the characterization of the continuum of states.
We describe our fast identification of transitions from one state to another,
enabling the trigger of observations in the gamma-ray band and follow-up
spectroscopic observations. Finally, we review the communication channel we set
from the ZTF to the CTAO via Fink for blazars and discuss its outlook in light
of the Rubin Observatory. This method is also applicable to other astrophysical
sources and helps lay the groundwork for a fruitful era for time-domain
astronomy.

Method: 通过LOFAR望远镜进行快速响应模式的后续观测，结合Swift卫星的高能脉冲数据，使用60秒和180秒的时间切片成像在120-168 MHz频段进行分析。

Result: 所有四个长伽马射线暴均未检测到显著的无线电脉冲发射，仅在GRB 200925B中观察到约60-360秒后的小幅无线电通量增加，但信号与噪声比仅为约2，不足以确认同步发射。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持了磁风模型，但未发现无线电发射与伽马射线同步的证据，对GRB的磁参数进行了有限的限制，且这些结果与之前的GRB研究结果基本一致。

Abstract: Relativistic jets generated in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) produce luminous
transient events, yet the fundamentals of jet composition and radiation
mechanisms remain unclear. One means of identifying a magnetically-dominated
outflow would be detection of prompt, coherent radio emission at low
frequencies, and we are able to search for this using the LOw Frequency ARray
(LOFAR) coupled with modelling of high energy pulses detected by the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift). We present the rapid response mode follow-up
LOFAR observations of four long GRBs, each beginning within a few hundred
seconds of the initial Swift-BAT trigger. We interpreted our findings under the
framework of a magnetic wind model, predicting coherent radio emission
analogous to prompt emission pulses. Using 60 second and 180 second time sliced
imaging at 120-168 MHz, we obtain upper limits on radio pulse emission, finding
no significant signals. In the case of GRB 200925B, we observed a small
increase of radio flux seen at $\sim$60-360 s post burst. In this model, this
could represent the radio emission related to the Swift-BAT pulses, for a
redshift of $z=1.8$, however, with a low signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 2$, it
is not deemed significant enough to confirm coincident prompt radio and
gamma-ray emission. Instead, we can constrain the $\epsilon_{B}$ parameter,
deriving upper limits of $\epsilon_{B} < 4.2 \times 10^{-4}$ for GRB 200925B.
In GRB 240414A, with a reported redshift of $z=1.833$, we constrain
$\epsilon_{B} < 2.8 \times 10^{-4}$. We discuss these results in the context of
our whole LOFAR rapid response sample of six long gamma-ray bursts, finding our
$\epsilon_{B}$ values are generally consistent with previous GRB studies.

### [40] [A Two-Stage Kick Scenario for the Peculiar LMXB GX 1+4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21177)
*Xiangyu Ivy Wang,Shi-Jie Gao,Xiang-Dong Li*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores the unique properties of the LMXB GX 1+4, focusing on its unusually high peculiar velocity and long orbital period, and proposes a two-stage kick mechanism to explain these features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the discrepancy between the observed high peculiar velocity of GX 1+4 and the typical low kick velocities expected from accretion induced collapse (AIC) models.

Method: The study uses Monte Carlo simulations within the AIC framework to model a two-stage kick scenario: an initial natal kick and a delayed electromagnetic 'rocket effect' kick.

Result: The simulations show that a combination of an initial kick (<100 km/s) and a subsequent rocket kick (~240-480 km/s) can reproduce the observed high systemic velocity and low eccentricity of GX 1+4.

Conclusion: The two-stage kick mechanism, involving a re-emergence of the NS's buried magnetic field, offers a plausible explanation for GX 1+4's unique characteristics, suggesting the importance of rocket kicks in the formation of LMXB systems.

Abstract: The low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 1+4 stands out with its unique
properties. Despite being an old system, it hosts a strongly magnetized neutron
star (NS), a trait usually linked to younger systems. Its exceptionally long
orbital period (1160 days) and low eccentricity (0.101) imply that the NS
formed with minimal mass loss and a weak natal kick. These features
collectively point towards the NS having formed through the accretion induced
collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD). However, GX 1+4's unusually high peculiar
velocity (~ 189.36 km/s) defies standard AIC explanations. To address this
discrepancy, we propose a two-stage kick scenario within the AIC framework: an
initial natal kick followed by a delayed electromagnetic "rocket effect" kick.
Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that while the natal kick (< 100 km/s) can
generate a wide range of orbital eccentricities, the subsequent rocket kick (~
240-480 km/s) explains both the high systemic velocity and low eccentricity.
This two-stage kick mechanism naturally reproduces the observed characteristics
of GX 1+4, provided that the NS's initially buried magnetic field re-emerges
after the acceleration process ends. Our study represents the first attempt to
quantitatively constrain the kick velocities in GX 1+4 and underscores the
importance of possible rocket kicks in forming such peculiar LMXB systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using VLBI-derived astrometric priors to improve pulsar timing accuracy and reduce biases from red noise absorption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pulsar astrometry is crucial for high-precision timing experiments, but traditional methods face challenges with sub-milliarcsecond estimations requiring long observation periods and potential biases from red noise.

Method: The authors calibrated frame ties between VLBI and timing reference frames, then combined VLBI priors with timing likelihoods to find a maximum-posterior astrometric solution.

Result: They observed offsets between their results and timing-based solutions, which could affect GW detection, but found no significant power absorption in the low-frequency GW background.

Conclusion: Utilizing VLBI priors can enhance pulsar timing accuracy and mitigate red noise biases, though further validation is needed to confirm potential GW signal impacts.

Abstract: Accurate pulsar astrometric estimates play an essential role in almost all
high-precision pulsar timing experiments. Traditional pulsar timing techniques
refine these estimates by including them as free parameters when fitting a
model to observed pulse time-of-arrival measurements. However, reliable
sub-milliarcsecond astrometric estimations require years of observations and,
even then, power from red noise can be inadvertently absorbed into astrometric
parameter fits, biasing the resulting estimations and reducing our sensitivity
to red noise processes, including gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we
seek to mitigate these shortcomings by using pulsar astrometric estimates
derived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) as priors for the timing
fit. First, we calibrated a frame tie to account for the offsets between the
reference frames used in VLBI and timing. Then, we used the VLBI-informed
priors and timing-based likelihoods of several astrometric solutions consistent
with both techniques to obtain a maximum-posterior astrometric solution. We
found offsets between our results and the timing-based astrometric solutions,
which, if real, would lead to absorption of spectral power at frequencies of
interest for single-source GW searches. However, we do not find significant
power absorption due to astrometric fitting at the low-frequency domain of the
GW background.

Motivation: 探索潮汐撕裂事件（TDE）中延迟和快速上升的无线电发射现象，尤其是在存在活动星系核（AGN）的矮星系中的TDE。

Method: 使用高分辨率VLBA和e-MERLIN无线电观测技术，对AT2018cqh进行长期观测，并结合水动力模拟分析TDE喷流与稠密云的相互作用。

Conclusion: TDE喷流与稠密云的相互作用是解释某些TDE中延迟、快速上升无线电发射的关键机制，特别是在已有AGN活动的星系中。

Abstract: AT2018cqh is a unique optical tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in a
dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results
from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh
extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact
radio emission, unresolved at a scale of <~ 0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high
brightness temperature of $T_b$ ~> 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral
energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak
flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition
analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region
over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The
radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting
for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard
shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if
dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is
supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow
with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This
work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining
the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those
occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.

Conclusion: 尽管发现的脉冲星可能属于银河盘而非核球，但这些结果与银河系中心异常发射由毫秒脉冲星解释的假设并不矛盾，因为仅需一到两个这样的脉冲星即可解释该异常。

Abstract: The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has revealed a mysterious extended
excess of GeV gamma-ray emission around the Galactic Center, which can
potentially be explained by unresolved emission from a population of pulsars,
particularly millisecond pulsars (MSPs), in the Galactic bulge. We used the
distributed volunteer computing system Einstein@Home to search the Fermi-LAT
data for gamma-ray pulsations from sources in the inner Galaxy, to try to
identify the brightest members of this putative population. We discovered four
new pulsars, including one new MSP and one young pulsar whose angular
separation to the Galactic Center of 0.93{\deg} is the smallest of any known
gamma-ray pulsar. We demonstrate a phase-resolved difference imaging technique
that allows the flux from this pulsar to be disentangled from the diffuse
Galactic Center emission. No radio pulsations were detected from the four new
pulsars in archival radio observations or during the MPIfR-MeerKAT Galactic
Plane Survey. While the distances to these pulsars remain uncertain, we find
that it is more likely that they are all foreground sources from the Galactic
disk, rather than pulsars originating from the predicted bulge population.
Nevertheless, our results are not incompatible with an MSP explanation for the
GC excess, as only one or two members of this population would have been
detectable in our searches.

Abstract: The detection of very high-energy gamma-rays from M87 can provide crucial
insights into particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in jets. The
recent observations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO)
detector extend the energy range of TeV gamma-ray astronomy, and also the
variability study to the TeV energy domain. We have modelled the low state and
flare state multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of M87 within a
time-dependent framework. In our model, the low state gamma-ray flux results
from the emissions from the sub-parsec and the kilo-parsec scale jets of M87,
whereas the flare state gamma-ray flux is mainly produced in the sub-parsec
scale jet. We have shown that the spectral and temporal features of the TeV
gamma-ray spectrum of M87 are consistent with this two-zone model, where the
contribution from the sub-parsec scale jet significantly increases during the
flare state.
