In\nthis paper, after reviewing the classical plasma-lensing theory, we have found\na fundamental contradiction: the classical model assumes that the distribution\nof lensing plasma medium is related to the frequency-independent image\nposition; however, our analysis demonstrates that both the image position\n($\\theta(\\nu)$) and dispersion measure (DM$(\\nu)$) are inherently\nfrequency-dependent when signals traverse a structured plasma medium.\n  We have been able to resolve this paradox by developing a framework that\nexplicitly incorporates frequency-dependent dispersion measures (DMs) following\npower-law relationships ($\\rm DM\\propto \\nu^\\gamma$). Our analysis shows that\nthe signal magnification decreases systematically with decreasing frequency,\noffering a plausible explanation for the frequency-dependent peak flux\ndensities observed in fast radio bursts (FRBs), particularly in the case of the\nrepeating FRB 180814.J0422+73. Our results suggest these FRBs could originate\nfrom the magnetized compact star magnetospheres.

This approach is applied to a sample of\n32 well-observed SNe II, using a light curve model grid constructed from RSGs\nwith arbitrarily stripped hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than assuming a fixed\nwind model.

One means of identifying a magnetically-dominated\noutflow would be detection of prompt, coherent radio emission at low\nfrequencies, and we are able to search for this using the LOw Frequency ARray\n(LOFAR) coupled with modelling of high energy pulses detected by the Neil\nGehrels Swift Observatory (Swift). We present the rapid response mode follow-up\nLOFAR observations of four long GRBs, each beginning within a few hundred\nseconds of the initial Swift-BAT trigger. We interpreted our findings under the\nframework of a magnetic wind model, predicting coherent radio emission\nanalogous to prompt emission pulses. Using 60 second and 180 second time sliced\nimaging at 120-168 MHz, we obtain upper limits on radio pulse emission, finding\nno significant signals. In the case of GRB 200925B, we observed a small\nincrease of radio flux seen at $\\sim$60-360 s post burst. In this model, this\ncould represent the radio emission related to the Swift-BAT pulses, for a\nredshift of $z=1.8$, however, with a low signal-to-noise ratio of $\\sim 2$, it\nis not deemed significant enough to confirm coincident prompt radio and\ngamma-ray emission.

Despite being an old system, it hosts a strongly magnetized neutron\nstar (NS), a trait usually linked to younger systems. Its exceptionally long\norbital period (1160 days) and low eccentricity (0.101) imply that the NS\nformed with minimal mass loss and a weak natal kick. These features\ncollectively point towards the NS having formed through the accretion induced\ncollapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD). However, GX 1+4's unusually high peculiar\nvelocity (~ 189.36 km/s) defies standard AIC explanations. To address this\ndiscrepancy, we propose a two-stage kick scenario within the AIC framework: an\ninitial natal kick followed by a delayed electromagnetic \"rocket effect\" kick.\nOur Monte Carlo simulations indicate that while the natal kick (< 100 km/s) can\ngenerate a wide range of orbital eccentricities, the subsequent rocket kick (~\n240-480 km/s) explains both the high systemic velocity and low eccentricity.\nThis two-stage kick mechanism naturally reproduces the observed characteristics\nof GX 1+4, provided that the NS's initially buried magnetic field re-emerges\nafter the acceleration process ends. Our study represents the first attempt to\nquantitatively constrain the kick velocities in GX 1+4 and underscores the\nimportance of possible rocket kicks in forming such peculiar LMXB systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

First, we calibrated a frame tie to account for the offsets between the\nreference frames used in VLBI and timing.

We\nfound offsets between our results and the timing-based astrometric solutions,\nwhich, if real, would lead to absorption of spectral power at frequencies of\ninterest for single-source GW searches.

This\nwork highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining\nthe delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those\noccurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.", "AI": {"tldr": "AT2018cqh \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u6f6e\u6c50\u6495\u88c2\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08TDE\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u8000\u6591\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387VLBA\u548ce-MERLIN\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u57df\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4eae\u5ea6\u6e29\u5ea6\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u88ab\u7a20\u5bc6\u4e91\u56e2\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76AT2018cqh\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u8ba8\u6f6e\u6c50\u6495\u88c2\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08TDE\uff09\u4e2d\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387VLBA\u548ce-MERLIN\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bf9AT2018cqh\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u8fbe2250\u5929\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6c34\u52a8\u529b\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76TDE\u55b7\u6d41\u4e0e\u4e91\u56e2\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u57df\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4eae\u5ea6\u6e29\u5ea6\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535SED\u57281000\u5929\u5185\u9010\u6e10\u5411\u66f4\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5cf0\u503c\u901a\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c0.89 GHz\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u4e0a\u5347\u5e76\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a240\u5929\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u4e0d\u80fd\u88ab\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7TDE\u55b7\u6d41\u4e0e\u4e91\u56e2\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u4e0a\u5347\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u53d1\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6709\u9884\u5b58AGN\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u3002"}}

We used the\ndistributed volunteer computing system Einstein@Home to search the Fermi-LAT\ndata for gamma-ray pulsations from sources in the inner Galaxy, to try to\nidentify the brightest members of this putative population. We discovered four\nnew pulsars, including one new MSP and one young pulsar whose angular\nseparation to the Galactic Center of 0.93{\\deg} is the smallest of any known\ngamma-ray pulsar. We demonstrate a phase-resolved difference imaging technique\nthat allows the flux from this pulsar to be disentangled from the diffuse\nGalactic Center emission. No radio pulsations were detected from the four new\npulsars in archival radio observations or during the MPIfR-MeerKAT Galactic\nPlane Survey. While the distances to these pulsars remain uncertain, we find\nthat it is more likely that they are all foreground sources from the Galactic\ndisk, rather than pulsars originating from the predicted bulge population.\nNevertheless, our results are not incompatible with an MSP explanation for the\nGC excess, as only one or two members of this population would have been\ndetectable in our searches.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper reports the discovery of four new pulsars, including one millisecond pulsar and one young pulsar close to the Galactic Center, using Fermi-LAT data and Einstein@Home.", "motivation": "To investigate the potential explanation of the mysterious GeV gamma-ray excess around the Galactic Center, which might originate from unresolved pulsars in the bulge.", "method": "The researchers analyzed Fermi-LAT data using the distributed volunteer computing system Einstein@Home to search for gamma-ray pulsations in the inner Galaxy and employed a phase-resolved difference imaging technique to separate pulsar signals from diffuse Galactic Center emission.", "result": "Four new pulsars were discovered, including one millisecond pulsar and one young pulsar with the smallest angular separation to the Galactic Center of any known gamma-ray pulsar.

The\nrecent observations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO)\ndetector extend the energy range of TeV gamma-ray astronomy, and also the\nvariability study to the TeV energy domain. We have modelled the low state and\nflare state multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of M87 within a\ntime-dependent framework. In our model, the low state gamma-ray flux results\nfrom the emissions from the sub-parsec and the kilo-parsec scale jets of M87,\nwhereas the flare state gamma-ray flux is mainly produced in the sub-parsec\nscale jet. We have shown that the spectral and temporal features of the TeV\ngamma-ray spectrum of M87 are consistent with this two-zone model, where the\ncontribution from the sub-parsec scale jet significantly increases during the\nflare state.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
