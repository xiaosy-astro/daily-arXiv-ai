We compute the star\nformation rate density (SFRD) to $z=3.5$ by directly integrating individual\ngalaxy SFRs. The SFRD peaks at $z=1.3\\pm0.1$, with peak value $0.08\\pm0.01$\nM$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We classify star-forming (SF) and quiescent\n(Q) galaxies using specific SFR $<10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparing with $NUVrJ$\ncolour selection. The sSFR criterion yields up to 20% smaller quiescent\nfractions across $0<z<3.5$, with $NUVrJ$-selected samples contaminated by\ngalaxies with sSFR up to $10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our sSFR-selected stellar mass\nfunction shows a negligible number density of low-mass ($<10^{9.5}$ M$_\\odot$)\nQ galaxies at $z\\sim1$, where colour-selection shows a prominent increase.\nNon-parametric star formation histories around the SFRD peak reveal distinct\npatterns: SF galaxies show gradually decreasing SFR correlations with lookback\ntime ($r\\sim1$ to $r\\sim0$ over 13 Gyr), implying increasingly stochastic star\nformation toward early epochs. Q galaxies exhibit full correlation ($r>0.95$)\nduring the most recent $\\sim$300 Myr, then sharp decorrelation with earlier\nstar-forming epochs, marking clear quenching transitions.

Imaging and\nmodeling techniques have revealed an expanding shell-like ejecta structure,\nwith a width well-constrained after ~1000 days. In this work, we present a\nre-analysis of the first ~1700 days of SN 1993J evolution, using a new VLBI\nanalysis technique with somewhat intrinsically higher angular resolution and\ncompare our results with those from previous conventional techniques. We adopt\nthe m-ring model, with potentially somewhat higher angular resolution, but only\nas a phenomenological alternative to the physically-motivated spherical shell\nmodel used in past analyses and shape the profile to approximately match that\nof the shell. We use closure quantities only, providing calibration insensitive\nconstraints on ejecta geometry and largely independent comparisons with\nprevious results from the same data sets. Using this approach we find the\nejecta expanding with a power-law exponent $\\omega=0.80\\pm0.01$ averaged for\nthe time from 175 to 1693 days, consistent with shell-fitting analyses. For the\nfirst time, we report estimates of the ejecta width at t < 1000 days -- as\nearly as 264 days post-explosion -- finding a mean fractional width with\nstandard deviation of $0.24 \\pm 0.04$ (of the radius) with no significant\nevolution. We present a fit of the azimuthal brightness modulation over time\nwith the maximum of a horseshoe pattern rotating from east to south-southwest\nfrom 175 to 1000 d and then evolving to a more complex behavior, quantifying\nprevious results from images only. The constraints on the angular brightness\nmodulation and width over time and ~700 days earlier than existing analyses\nprovide an avenue to test more advanced simulations of the explosion and\ninteraction mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u4e861993J\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7206\u53d1\u540e\u7ea61700\u5929\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684VLBI\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u89d2\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81a8\u80c0\u58f3\u72b6\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u7206\u70b8\u540e264\u5929\u7684\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7684VLBI\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u95ed\u5408\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5728175\u81f31693\u5929\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u81a8\u80c0\u9075\u5faa\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u03c9=0.80\u00b10.01\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7206\u70b8\u540e\u65e9\u671f\uff08t<1000\u5929\uff09\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u5bbd\u5ea6\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u6570\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e3a0.24\u00b10.04\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u534a\u5f84\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e14\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89d2\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u5bf9\u55b7\u5c04\u7269\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u523b\u753b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, estimates of\nexplosion properties based on optical light curve modeling often show tension\nwith the predictions of modern neutrino-driven explosion models. In particular,\nwhen based on light curves from the explosions of red supergiant (RSG) tied to\nspecific stellar wind models, many SNe II are found to originate from low-mass\nprogenitors yet exhibit unusually high explosion energies ($E_{\\rm K}$), far\nexceeding theoretical predictions. In this study, we incorporate late-phase\n(nebular) spectroscopy to estimate the helium core mass of the progenitor\n($M_{\\rm He\\,core}$), which serves as an additional constraint to break\ndegeneracies in light curve modeling. This approach is applied to a sample of\n32 well-observed SNe II, using a light curve model grid constructed from RSGs\nwith arbitrarily stripped hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than assuming a fixed\nwind model. Examining the resulting correlations among the physical parameters,\nwe find that the tension between the observed $M_{\\rm He\\,core}$-$E_{\\rm K}$\nand $E_{\\rm K}$-$M_{\\rm Ni}$ relations and those predicted by neutrino-driven\nexplosion models has significantly lessened by incorporating nebular\nspectroscopy in light curve modeling.

To break\nthe degeneracy between quasar and stellar heating, we use CO (J=5-4), observed\nin Band 5, to gauge the expected contribution of star formation to the infrared\nluminosity. We find very good agreement between the strength and spatial\ndistribution of the extended continuum component and its prediction based on CO\n(J=5-4). This is supported by the location of our three quasars along the L_(CO\n5-4)-L_(IR, SFR) luminosity relation for inactive star-forming galaxies. As a\nconsequence, there is no evidence for additional continuum emission on extended\nscales which could be attributed to quasar-heated dust. As expected, the\nnuclear (i.e., torus) contribution is present and subdominant (12% in Band 9\nfor one quasar with a typical star-forming host) or non-existent (<8% in Band 9\nfor the starbursting host). Based on the continuum and CO, the presence of\nsubstantial levels of ongoing star formation agrees with previous estimates\nfrom unresolved ALMA continuum observations which finds SFRs consistent with\nstar-forming main-sequence galaxies.

In addition, pulsating\nultraluminous X-ray sources in nearby galaxies follow the similar relationship.\nWe demonstrate that most of these systems are close to the spin equilibrium,\nand that brighter pulsars have acquired more angular momentum by accreting\nmatter from their companion stars, resulting in faster rotating NSs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u53d1\u73b0X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8109\u51b2\u661f\uff08XRPs\uff09\u4e2d\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684\u81ea\u8f6c\u5468\u671f\u4e0e\u5176\u7206\u53d1\u53c2\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u8f6c\u7684\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5267\u70c8\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u90bb\u8fd1\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u8109\u52a8\u8d85\u4eaeX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6e90\u4e5f\u9075\u5faa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a5\u8fd1\u81ea\u8f6c\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4eae\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u901a\u8fc7\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u8d28\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u78c1\u5316\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u4f9b\u4f53\u661f\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u901a\u8fc7\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u8d28\u4ea7\u751f\u8109\u51b2X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8f90\u5c04\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f9b\u4f53\u661f\u662fBe\u578b\u661f\uff0c\u5438\u79ef\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u901a\u5e38X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6697\uff0c\u4f46\u5076\u5c14\u7206\u53d1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9bX\u5c04\u7ebf\u7206\u53d1\u7684\u7279\u6027\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528X\u5c04\u7ebf\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u81ea\u8f6c\u5468\u671f\u4e0e\u7206\u53d1\u53c2\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u53d1\u73b0X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u81ea\u8f6c\u5468\u671f\u4e0e\u7206\u53d1\u53c2\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u8f6c\u7684\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5267\u70c8\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u3002\u90bb\u8fd1\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u8109\u52a8\u8d85\u4eaeX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6e90\u4e5f\u7b26\u5408\u6b64\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u63a5\u8fd1\u81ea\u8f6c\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4eae\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u8d28\u5438\u79ef\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u591a\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u81ea\u8f6c\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

One means of identifying a magnetically-dominated\noutflow would be detection of prompt, coherent radio emission at low\nfrequencies, and we are able to search for this using the LOw Frequency ARray\n(LOFAR) coupled with modelling of high energy pulses detected by the Neil\nGehrels Swift Observatory (Swift). We present the rapid response mode follow-up\nLOFAR observations of four long GRBs, each beginning within a few hundred\nseconds of the initial Swift-BAT trigger. We interpreted our findings under the\nframework of a magnetic wind model, predicting coherent radio emission\nanalogous to prompt emission pulses. Using 60 second and 180 second time sliced\nimaging at 120-168 MHz, we obtain upper limits on radio pulse emission, finding\nno significant signals. In the case of GRB 200925B, we observed a small\nincrease of radio flux seen at $\\sim$60-360 s post burst.

We test\nobservational assumptions used to derive outflow properties from synthetic\nspectra. We find the greatest uncertainty lies in measurements of electron\ndensity, as estimates using the SII doublet can overestimate the actual\nelectron density by up to 2 dex, which changes mass outflow rates by up to 4\ndex. We also find that molecular outflows are especially sensitive to the\nconversion factor between CO luminosity and H2 mass, with outflow rates\nchanging by up to 4 dex in our least massive galaxy. Comparing the outflow\nproperties derived from the synthetic spectra to those derived directly from\nthe simulation, we find that [CII]$_{158\\rm{\\mu m}}$ probes outflows at greater\ndistances from the disk, whilst we find that molecular gas does not survive at\nlarge distances within outflows within our modestly star-forming disk galaxies\nsimulated in this work.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We used the\ndistributed volunteer computing system Einstein@Home to search the Fermi-LAT\ndata for gamma-ray pulsations from sources in the inner Galaxy, to try to\nidentify the brightest members of this putative population.

We demonstrate a phase-resolved difference imaging technique\nthat allows the flux from this pulsar to be disentangled from the diffuse\nGalactic Center emission. No radio pulsations were detected from the four new\npulsars in archival radio observations or during the MPIfR-MeerKAT Galactic\nPlane Survey. While the distances to these pulsars remain uncertain, we find\nthat it is more likely that they are all foreground sources from the Galactic\ndisk, rather than pulsars originating from the predicted bulge population.\nNevertheless, our results are not incompatible with an MSP explanation for the\nGC excess, as only one or two members of this population would have been\ndetectable in our searches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u9644\u8fd1\u7684GeV\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d1\u5c04\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u6838\u7403\u4e2d\u7684\u6beb\u79d2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Einstein@Home\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u65b0\u8109\u51b2\u661f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u6beb\u79d2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ddd\u79bb\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\u8109\u51b2\u661f\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u5728\u5c04\u7535\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u53ef\u80fd\u5c5e\u4e8e\u94f6\u6cb3\u76d8\u800c\u975e\u6838\u7403\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u9644\u8fd1GeV\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u5f02\u5e38\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u672a\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u660e\u4eae\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8be5\u5f02\u5e38\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7531\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u4f7f\u7528Einstein@Home\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5fd7\u613f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8d39\u7c73-LAT\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u6765\u81ea\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u8109\u51b2\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76f8\u4f4d\u5206\u8fa8\u5dee\u5206\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u6765\u533a\u5206\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5f25\u6563\u8f90\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u6beb\u79d2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ddd\u79bb\u94f6\u6cb3\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u6210\u529f\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5f25\u6f2b\u8f90\u5c04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u53ef\u80fd\u5c5e\u4e8e\u94f6\u6cb3\u76d8\u800c\u975e\u6838\u7403\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f02\u5e38\u53d1\u5c04\u7531\u6beb\u79d2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u5e76\u4e0d\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ec5\u9700\u4e00\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u5373\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8be5\u5f02\u5e38\u3002"}}
