Abstract: We investigate the gravitational wave emission for 10 supernova progenitors
from magnetorotational core-collapse to the supernova explosion using fully
three-dimensional dynamical-spacetime general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics
simulations with the GPU-accelerated code $\texttt{GRaM-X}$. We consider 2
progenitors of zero-age-main-sequence mass $25M_\odot$ and 8 with
zero-age-main-sequence masses of $35M_\odot$. For these models, we explore a
range of rotation rates between $0.0$ and $3.5 \mathrm{rad}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$,
along with initial seed magnetic field of either $10^{12}\mathrm{G}$ or
$10^{13}\mathrm{G}$. The analysis of the 10 models presented provides a
comprehensive and systematic initial investigation of the interplay between
progenitor rotation, magnetic field strength, and progenitor structure in
shaping the explosion dynamics and gravitational wave (GW) emission. We find
that stronger seed magnetic fields ($10^{13}\mathrm{G}$) suppress the GW strain
amplitude relative to models with weaker initial fields ($10^{12}\mathrm{G}$).
Increasing the initial rotation rate results in a more dynamical explosion,
yielding correspondingly stronger gravitational waves. In addition, the
progenitor mass/composition also exhibit a significant impact on the explosion
dynamics and the morphology of the resulting waveforms. Finally, we find that
all of our models lie above the detectability threshold for 3rd generation
detectors aLIGO, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic explorer at a $10\mathrm{kpc}$
distance and most would even still be detectable at $10\mathrm{Mpc}$, opening
the possibility for observing gravitational wave emission for CCSNe beyond our
galaxy.

### [2] [Vacuum birefringence in the polarized X-ray emission of a radio magnetar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19446)
*Rachael E. Stewart,Hoa Dinh Thi,George Younes,Marcus E. Lower,Matthew G. Baring,Michela Negro,Fernando Camilo,Joel B. Coley,Alice K. Harding,Wynn C. G. Ho,Chin-Ping Hu,Philip Kaaret,Paul Scholz,Alex Van Kooten,Zorawar Wadiasingh*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The detection of high X-ray polarization in the magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 provides strong evidence for quantum vacuum birefringence (VB) in ultra-strong magnetic fields, a key prediction of quantum electrodynamics (QED). Observations from IXPE, NICER, and Parkes/Murriyang show polarization degrees of up to 80%, inconsistent with standard models without VB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Confirm QED's prediction that ultra-strong magnetic fields (e.g., those around magnetars) induce vacuum birefringence, a phenomenon not yet directly observed.

Method: Combining X-ray polarization measurements (IXPE), radio observations (NICER/Parkes), and radiative-transfer modeling to analyze polarization behavior linked to magnetospheric VB effects.

Result: Measured polarization of 65% at 2 keV (thermal emission peak), up to 80% at specific phases, and ≥40% during radio beam crossings. Significant polarization drop between 2–4 keV was observed, consistent with VB effects.

Conclusion: VB's observational proof in astrophysical settings marks a breakthrough in QED verification and opens avenues for future studies on strong-field quantum phenomena.

Abstract: The quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory predicts that the quantum vacuum
becomes birefringent in the presence of ultra-strong magnetic fields -- a
fundamental effect yet to be directly observed. Magnetars, isolated neutron
stars with surface fields exceeding $10^{14}$~G, provide unique astrophysical
laboratories to probe this elusive prediction. Here, we report phase- and
energy-resolved X-ray polarization measurements of the radio-emitting magnetar
1E 1547.0-5408 obtained with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), in
coordination with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and
Parkes/Murriyang radio observations. We detect a high phase-averaged
polarization degree of 65% at 2 keV, where the surface thermal emission is
dominant, rising to nearly 80% at certain rotational phases, and remaining at
$\gtrsim40\%$ throughout the radio beam crossing. We also observe a strong
decrease in polarization from 2~keV to 4~keV. Detailed atmospheric radiative
transfer modeling, coupled with geometrical constraints from radio
polarization, demonstrate that the observed polarization behavior cannot be
consistently explained without invoking magnetospheric vacuum birefringence
(VB) influences. These observational findings combined with the theoretical
results represent compelling evidence for naturally occurring quantum VB. This
work marks a significant advance toward confirming this hallmark prediction of
QED and lays the foundation for future tests of strong-field quantum physics
using next-generation X-ray polarimeters.

### [3] [A Yin-Yang Galaxy Cluster Merger in Abell 1914 Revealed by XRISM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19449)
*Annie Heinrich,Congyao Zhang,Irina Zhuravleva,Eugene Churazov,Hannah McCall,Reinout J. van Weeren,William R. Forman*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the massive galaxy cluster A1914 using XRISM's high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, revealing a near line-of-sight merger of two subclusters with a velocity offset of ~1000 km/s, forming a 'yin-yang' spiral pattern. Simulations confirm this scenario explains observed X-ray morphology and kinematic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve discrepancies in A1914 where galaxy and dark matter distributions conflict with X-ray morphology, and to exploit XRISM's capabilities to study line-of-sight velocity structures in cluster mergers.

Method: Analyzed XRISM Resolve spectra and sub-array maps of A1914 to identify two merging components with distinct velocities and dispersions. Compared observational results with hydrodynamical simulations of the merger scenario.

Result: Two overlapping subclusters with ~1000 km/s velocity offset and ~200 km/s dispersion, forming a 'yin-yang' merger at ~200 kpc pericenter. Simulations align with observed X-ray features, velocity maps, and matter distributions.

Conclusion: XRISM's spectral resolution successfully disentangled complex merger geometry in A1914, validating its utility for studying cluster mergers and reconciling multi-component observational tensions through near-line-of-sight merger dynamics.

Abstract: Hierarchical mergers of galaxy clusters play a key role in converting
gravitational energy into thermal and kinetic energy in the local universe.
Understanding this process requires the reconstruction of cluster merger
geometry, with careful consideration of projection effects. With its
unprecedented spectral resolution, XRISM enables the disentanglement of merging
cluster components along the line-of-sight via X-rays for the first time. In
this letter, we focus on the massive cluster A1914, a puzzling case wherein the
galaxy and dark matter distribution appear to be in tension with the X-ray
morphology. We present XRISM observations of A1914 focusing on the velocity
structure of the intracluster medium (ICM). The Resolve full-array spectrum
requires two merging components along the line-of-sight, with bulk velocities
offset by $\sim$1000 km/s and velocity dispersions of $\sim$200 km/s. The
sub-array maps of flux ratios, bulk velocity, and velocity dispersion show the
two components are offset and overlapping in the plane of the sky, consistent
with a major (mass ratio $\sim$3), near line-of-sight merger with a pericenter
distance of $\sim$200 kpc. We conclude that the two subclusters create an
overlapping spiral pattern, referred to as a ''yin-yang'' merger. This scenario
is further supported by tailored hydrodynamical simulations of the A1914
merger, demonstrating that this type of merger can broadly reproduce the
observed X-ray morphology, gas temperature map, gas velocity maps, dark matter
distribution, and galaxy velocities. This work demonstrates the power of
high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, provided by XRISM, to resolve complex
cluster merger geometries.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are very promising laboratories for the
indirect search for dark matter (DM), due to their low astrophysical background
in radio and gamma-ray frequencies. This is convenient when considering Weakly
Interacting Dark Matter (WIMP) that can annihilate and produce radio continuum
emission. Radio detections of dSph galaxies, however, prove to be difficult and
motivate the consideration of transient galaxies that have just recently become
quiescent.
  For the past several decades, the prompt emission from DM annihilation
signatures has been explored through modeling and the setting of limits. In
addition to the prompt annihilation signatures from neutrinos, gamma-rays,
electrons, positrons, and antimatter, the secondary emission from charged
annihilation products undergoing radiative loss processes also contributes to
the picture. For instance, synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering
of charged products such as electrons and positrons can provide a significant
signal. The quantitative modeling of this secondary emission with the
astrophysical background is necessary to place stringent constraints on the
nature of DM.
  In this work, the multi-wavelength secondary spectrum of DM annihilation for
a dwarf galaxy is calculated using the open-source code CRPropa 3.2, which
enables the self-consistent treatment of the astrophysical background and
secondary emissions. We present a systematic comparison of signatures from
conventional astrophysical processes to those expected from DM annihilation.
The morphological differences between the two scenarios are investigated. Tests
of the impact of different magnetic fields, DM masses, and DM profiles will be
performed in the next steps.

### [5] [Where did heavy binaries go? Gravitational-wave populations using Delaunay triangulation with optimized complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19466)
*Rodrigo Tenorio,Alexandre Toubiana,Tristan Bruel,Davide Gerosa,Jonathan R. Gair*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores the evolution of binary black hole merger rates with mass and redshift using the GWTC-4.0 catalog, employing a new non-parametric Delaunay triangulation method. It finds no evidence for a low-redshift mass peak (~70 solar masses) but identifies an increased merger rate at higher redshifts (~1) around those masses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the joint evolution of mass and redshift in binary black hole mergers observed in GWTC-4.0 and improve modeling techniques beyond current state-of-the-art methods requiring fewer parameters.

Method: A novel non-parametric framework based on Delaunay triangulation is introduced. It models multi-dimensional distributions without predefined parameters, inferring triangulation nodes' number, positions, and weights directly from data, leading to efficiency gains.

Result: No evidence of a mass peak (~70 solar masses) at low redshift (z~0.2) but detects increased merger rates at high redshift (z~1) in that mass range. The method requires fewer parameters and less calibration compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The findings suggest potential astrophysical scenarios where such high-mass mergers are more common at higher redshifts, implying evolutionary trends in black hole populations. The method's efficiency offers promising tools for future gravitational-wave analyses.

Abstract: We investigate the joint mass-redshift evolution of the binary black hole
merger rate in the latest gravitational-wave detection catalog, GWTC-4.0. We
present and apply a novel non-parametric framework for modeling
multi-dimensional, correlated distributions based on Delaunay triangulation.
Crucially, the complexity of the model -- namely, the number, positions, and
weights of triangulation nodes -- is inferred directly from the data, resulting
in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of
magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current
state-of-the-art methods. We find no evidence for a peak at $M_{\mathrm{tot}}
\sim 70\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at low redshift ($z \sim 0.2$), where it would
correspond to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature reported in
redshift-independent mass spectrum analyses, and we infer an increased merger
rate at high redshift $(z \sim 1)$ around those masses, compatible with such a
peak. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these results.

### [6] [Probing the Origin of X-ray Flares in the Low-Hard State of GRS 1915+105 Using AstroSat and NuSTAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19546)
*Shahzada Akhter,Sajad Boked,Bari Maqbool,Ranjeev Misra,V. Jithesh*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzed X-ray flares of GRS 1915+105 during its low-flux rebrightening phase using AstroSat and NuSTAR, revealing complex spectral behavior linked to disk dynamics, winds, and absorption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical mechanisms driving X-ray flares in GRS 1915+105 by investigating spectral variations and their connection to disk structure, winds, and absorption processes.

Method: Analyzed light curves and spectral data from AstroSat/NuSTAR using two models (reflection-dominated and absorption-dominated) to segment and fit flares, studying parameter variations with flux levels.

Result: Observed inward disk motion at high flux in Model A, anti-correlated column density with flux in Model B, step-function parameter changes at specific flux thresholds, and increased disk flux contribution with total flux.

Conclusion: Spectral variability arises from interplay between disk emission, winds, and variable absorption, suggesting multiple intrinsic and geometric effects control the flare dynamics.

Abstract: We performed a detailed time-resolved spectral study of GRS 1915+105 during
its low-flux rebrightening phase using the broadband capabilities of AstroSat
and NuSTAR in May-June 2019. The AstroSat light curves revealed erratic X-ray
flares with count rates rising by a factor of $\sim$5. Flares with simultaneous
LAXPC and SXT coverage were segmented and fitted using two degenerate but
physically motivated spectral models: a reflection-dominated model (hereafter
Model A) and an absorption-dominated model (hereafter Model B). In Model A, the
inner disk radius $(R_{in})$ shows a broken power-law dependence on flux,
indicating rapid inward motion of the disk at higher flux levels. In contrast,
Model B shows variable column density in the range of $10^{23}$ to $10^{24}$
cm$^{-2}$, displaying a strong anti-correlation with flux. Both models exhibit
significant variation in the ionization parameter between low- and high-flux
segments. The total unabsorbed luminosity in the 0.7--30~keV energy range
ranged from $6.64 \times 10^{36}$ to $6.33 \times 10^{38}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. Across
both models, several spectral parameters exhibited step-function-like behavior
around flux thresholds of $5$--$10 \times 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$,
indicating multiple spectral regimes. The disc flux contribution, more evident
in Model B, increased with total flux, supporting an intrinsic origin for the
variability. These findings point to a complex interplay between intrinsic disk
emission, structured winds, and variable local absorption in driving the flare
activity.

### [7] [Jet-driven explosion of an accretion-induced white-dwarf collapse via a magnetorotational dynamo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19799)
*Luciano Combi,Daniel M. Siegel,Brian D. Metzger*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses 3D general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with neutrinos to explore magnetorotational accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a rapidly spinning white dwarf with a subsurface magnetic field. Key findings include rapid magnetic field amplification via MRI-driven dynamo in the PNS disk, formation of a magnetic tower, and the launching of a relativistic jet, setting the stage for GRB and magnetar formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how rapidly rotating white dwarfs with weak subsurface magnetic fields can lead to the formation of millisecond pulsars/magnetars, gamma-ray bursts, and r-process elements through AIC. Previous studies might not have fully considered the 3D general relativistic effects and dynamo mechanisms in such scenarios.

Method: 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating neutrino transport. Simulations model AIC under rapid WD rotation with magnetic fields confined below the surface, focusing on post-bounce dynamics, MRI-driven dynamo action in the accretion disk, and jet formation mechanisms.

Result: Core bounce triggers exponential magnetic field growth near the PNS surface. An MRI-driven dynamo in the neutrino-cooled disk generates large-scale toroidal fields with alternating polarity. Buoyant magnetic flux forms a tower above the PNS, driving a mildly relativistic jet that escapes the WD, allowing a neutron-rich wind. These conditions are conducive to GRB production via magnetar spin-down energy.

Conclusion: Rapidly rotating AIC with subsurface magnetic fields can naturally produce the extreme magnetic fields and jets required for GRBs and magnetars. The MRI dynamo mechanism observed here may also apply to core-collapse SNe and neutron star mergers, highlighting its broader relevance in astrophysical transients.

Abstract: The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a rotating white dwarf (WD) offers a
potential site of millisecond pulsars/magnetars, gamma-ray bursts, and
r-process nucleosynthesis. We present three-dimensional general-relativistic
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including neutrinos of magnetorotational
AIC, assuming the WD is rapidly spinning with a weak magnetic field confined
below its surface (likely a prerequisite for rapid rotation). Within
milliseconds after core bounce, the magnetic field is exponentially amplified
near the surface of the proto-neutron star (PNS). We witness the emergence of a
small-scale turbulent and mean-field, large-scale MRI-driven dynamo in the
neutrino-cooled centrifugally supported disk formed around the PNS, which
generates bundles of large-scale toroidal field with alternating polarity. The
amplified field becomes buoyant and is advected above the PNS, generating a
magnetic tower that drives a mildly relativistic striped jet. The jet breaks
out of the WD, clearing the way for a powerful magnetized neutron-rich wind
from the disk. Although our simulation cannot follow the long-term
Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase of the PNS, the conditions are ripe for the
formation of a GRB powered by magnetar spin-down. A similar dynamo may operate
in magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of sub-Keplerian transonic accretion flow
onto a non-rotating black hole using axisymmetric viscous hydrodynamic
simulations. We simulate the accretion flow using boundary values from
semi-analytical analysis and set up three different models. Two of the models
do not predict accretion shocks from the semi-analytic analysis, while one of
them does. We also consider radiative cooling along with viscosity in the
simulation. Our two-dimensional simulation deviated from the one-dimensional
semi-analytical solution and admitted shocks in all three models. Viscous
dissipation tends to push the shock front outward, and radiative cooling will
push it in. Additionally, gravity is attractive. Depending on the competing
strengths of all three processes, it may trigger shock oscillation. Different
rates of angular-momentum transport in various layers may trigger eddies, which
will enhance the shock oscillation. We show that any simple power law cannot
approximate these solutions. We find that hot and higher angular-momentum flow
requires higher viscosity to produce oscillatory shocks. From the temporal
variation of the luminosity, shock oscillations generate QPOs in the range of
sub-Hertz to a few Hertz frequencies if a ten solar mass black hole is assumed.

### [9] [Empirical correlation between masses of black holes and Wolf-Rayet stars derived from their mass distributions in spectroscopic binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19981)
*Konstantin Postnov,Ivan Shaposhnikov,Anatol Cherepashchuk*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study derives mass distribution relationships for Wolf-Rayet stars, black holes in binaries, and establishes a power-law link between their masses, suggesting an empirical BH-CO core relation for population synthesis models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the evolutionary connection between massive stars and their black hole remnants, specifically how WR star masses relate to final BH masses.

Method: Analyses observed mass distributions of WR stars in WR+OB binaries and BHs in spectroscopic binaries using log-normal probability distributions, then establishes mass relations through core collapse modeling and empirical fitting.

Result: Found a power-law relation M_BH ≈ 0.39±0.09 * M_WR^(1.13±0.09) and an empirical BH-CO core ratio of ~0.9, applicable for population synthesis calculations.

Conclusion: The observed mass distributions support a direct evolutionary link where WR stars' CO cores determine BH masses, providing foundational data for simulating stellar evolution and black hole formation.

Abstract: We present observationally determined mass distributions of Wolf-Rayet (WR)
stars in WR+OB binaries and black holes (BH) in spectroscopic binaries. Both WR
and BH mass probability distributions can be well approximated by unbiased
log-normal functions. Assuming that all WR stars with $M_\mathrm{WR}\gtrsim 6
M_\odot$ after core collapse are progenitors of the BHs, the similar shape of
their mass distributions before and after collapse suggests a power-law
relation between them $M_{\mathrm{BH}} \simeq (0.39\pm0.09)
{M_{\mathrm{WR}}}^{1.13\pm0.09}$. Using the relation between masses of a WR
star and its CO-core, we obtain the empirical relation between the BH mass and
CO-core of the collapsing WR star $M_\mathrm{BH}\sim 0.9 M_\mathrm{CO}$, which
can be used in the population synthesis calculations.

### [10] [A Search for High-Energy Emission from the Remnant of Supernova 1181](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20131)
*J. Holder,Qiqi Jiang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents the first TeV gamma-ray study of the supernova remnant Pa 30, associated with SN 1181, which resulted from a rare Type Iax supernova. No significant TeV emission was detected, providing constraints on its particle acceleration processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Only four of the five historically recorded Galactic supernova remnants have been studied at TeV energies. The fifth, Pa 30, linked to SN 1181, was recently identified and its TeV properties remain unexplored. Understanding its emission can shed light on Type Iax supernova mechanics and remnants.

Method: VERITAS telescope array was used to observe Pa 30 at TeV energies. Data was analyzed to search for gamma-ray emission, with emphasis on spatial and spectral analysis to compare against model predictions.

Result: No statistically significant TeV gamma-ray signal was detected from Pa 30. Upper limits on TeV flux were established, which are the first constraints on its high-energy emission. These limits are comparable to the weakest detections of other supernova remnants like G21.5-0.9.

Conclusion: The non-detection suggests either lower particle acceleration efficiency or different acceleration mechanisms in Pa 30 compared to typical Type Ia remnants. Future observations with improved sensitivity could help resolve the remnant's high-energy behavior and inform models of zombie star-forming supernova explosions.

Abstract: Over the previous millennium, only five Galactic supernovae were observed and
recorded by contemporary astronomers, and their current-day counterparts
subsequently identified. The remnants of four of these have all been very
deeply studied, and ultimately detected, by TeV instruments after exposures of
typically hundreds of hours. The measured TeV fluxes range from 1 Crab (by
definition) down to 0.3% Crab. The location of the fifth supernova remnant tied
to a historical record of its supernova (SN 1181) has never been studied at TeV
energies. The reason for this is simple - the associated remnant was only
identified as such in 2021. The remnant, Pa 30, is an unusual object whose
properties are best explained as resulting from a Type Iax supernova explosion.
These are a rare sub-type of Type Ia supernovae in which the merging white
dwarfs are not fully destroyed by the supernova explosion, leading to a
double-degenerate merger product colorfully described as a 'zombie star'. We
will present the results of a search for TeV gamma-ray emission from Pa 30 with
VERITAS.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Context. Ionized outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to
influence the evolution of their host galaxies and super-massive black holes
(SMBHs). Distance is important to understand the kinetic power of the outflows
as a cosmic feedback channel. However, the distance of the outflows with
respect to the central engine is poorly constrained. The density of the
outflows is an essential parameter for estimating the distance of the outflows.
NGC 5548 exhibits a variety of spectroscopic features in its archival spectra,
which can be used for density analysis. Aims. We aim to use the variability of
the absorption lines from the archival spectra to obtain a density constraint
and then estimate the distance of the outflows. Methods. We used the archival
observations of NGC 5548 taken with Chandra in January 2002 to search for
variations of the absorption lines. Results. We found that the Mg XII
Ly${\alpha}$ and the O VIII Ly${\beta}$ absorption lines have significant
variation on the 144 ks time scale and the 162 ks time scale during the
different observation periods. Based on the variability timescales and the
physical properties of the variable components that dominated these two
absorption lines, we derive a lower limit on the density of the variable warm
absorber components in the range of $7.2-9.0{\times}10^{11} m^{-3}$, and an
upper limit on their distance from the central source in the range of 0.2-0.5
pc.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) as potential PeVatrons, using next-gen Cherenkov telescopes to analyze gamma-ray emissions and distinguish their morphology from TeV halos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if YMSCs can act as PeVatrons and to develop methods to classify them based on gamma-ray morphology using advanced telescopes like CTAO and ASTRI.

Method: Modeled gamma-ray emissions from 5 YMSCs, simulated observations with CTAO/ASTRI IRFs, compared emissions with HAWC's TeV halos, and tested classification methods on LHAASO catalog data.

Result: Identified key features like emission peaks to distinguish YMSCs from TeV halos, and estimated observational times needed for classification.

Conclusion: YMSCs are plausible PeVatron candidates; next-gen telescopes can resolve their structures, enabling reliable classification of these high-energy sources.

Abstract: The term PeVatron designates astrophysical objects capable of accelerating
particles to PeV energies. Their nature and particle acceleration mechanisms
are uncertain, but ultra-high-energy gamma rays are produced when particles
accelerated by either leptonic or hadronic PeVatrons interact with the
surrounding medium or radiation fields. The atmospheric air shower observatory
LHAASO detected photons with energies above 100 TeV from 43 sources in the
Galactic Plane, proving the existence of PeVatrons within the Milky Way. In
particular, one of the detections was a 1.4 PeV photon in spatial
correspondence with Cygnus OB2, providing a strong hint that young massive
stellar clusters (YMSCs) can act as PeVatrons. The next-generation Cherenkov
telescopes will have unprecedented energy and angular resolution. Therefore,
they will be able to resolve spatially YMSCs better than LHAASO. We focused on
a sample of 5 YMSCs and their environments visible from either hemisphere with
the CTAO or ASTRI Mini-Array. We modeled the gamma-ray emission above 1 TeV. We
devised methods for classifying YMSCs that could be detected as unidentified
extended TeV sources and estimated the observational time needed to distinguish
the morphology of different classes of sources. We study the morphology of the
sources in our sample in order to identify the main features. We simulated
observations of all sources with the instrument response function (IRF) of CTAO
or ASTRI Mini-Array. We compare their emission distribution to the one of the
TeV halos observed by HAWC. We parametrize their radial profiles in order to
develop methodologies to classify them and to distinguish YMSCs from TeV halos
based on their morphology. We expect some feature, such as the emission peak,
to be key in differentiating between the two classes of objects. We then test
them on a sample of sources of the first LHAASO catalog.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores the capability of future telescopes like CTAO and ASTRI Mini-Array to distinguish between different PeVatron candidates (like SNRs, pulsar nebulae, TeV halos) based on gamma-ray observations, aiming to better understand cosmic ray accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unresolved issue of PeV-scale cosmic ray acceleration and classify potential PeVatrons, as current instruments cannot differentiate between morphologies of certain sources.

Method: Simulation of gamma-ray emissions from TeV halos and YMSCs using observed radial profiles; testing classification methods on simulated CTAO/ASTRI data of LHAASO unidentified sources.

Result: Future IACTs will enhance morphological resolution to distinguish source classes, improving PeVatron candidate identification and acceleration mechanism understanding.

Conclusion: Next-gen telescopes are crucial for resolving source morphologies and refining PeVatrons classifications, advancing knowledge on cosmic accelerators.

Abstract: While Supernova Remnants (SNRs) are widely considered the primary
accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs) up to hundreds of TeV, they struggle to
account for the CR flux at PeV energies, suggesting the existence of additional
PeVatrons. Observations from LHAASO (Large High Altitude Air Shower
Observatory) have identified several PeVatron candidates, including some SNRs,
pulsar wind nebulae, TeV halos and young massive star clusters (YMSCs). These
objects accelerate particles that interact with the surrounding interstellar
medium and radiation fields, producing very-high-energy gamma rays (>100 TeV),
a key signature of both leptonic and hadronic PeVatrons. We simulate and model
the emission of TeV halos and YMSCs, adopting radial emission profiles derived
from observational data. Given the current angular resolution of gamma-ray
instruments, these profiles often appear similar, making it challenging to
distinguish between source classes. We explore how next-generation Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), namely the CTAO (Cherenkov Telescope
Array Observatory) and the ASTRI Mini-Array (Astrofisica con Specchi a
Tecnologia Replicante Italiana), can classify these sources based on their
morphology. We test our classification methods, derived from the profile
features of known sources, on simulated CTAO and ASTRI Mini-Array observations
of unidentified extended sources from the first LHAASO catalog. We present the
results of our analysis to highlight the potential of future IACT observations
in identifying the nature of extended gamma-ray sources, refining PeVatron
candidate classifications, and improving our understanding of cosmic-ray
accelerators.

### [14] [Spectral Uniformity of Little Red Dots: A Natural Outcome of Coevolving Seed Black Holes and Nascent Starbursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19422)
*Kohei Inayoshi,Kohta Murase,Kazumi Kashiyama*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The study examines the formation of massive black holes (BHs) and early galaxies in dense gaseous environments during cosmic dawn. It shows that super-Eddington BH accretion and concurrent starbursts create 'little red dots' (LRDs) with unique spectral features. These LRDs transition to normal AGN phases after ~15 Myr due to supernova-driven gas expulsion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the coevolution of massive BHs and galaxies at high redshifts, and explain the origin of LRDs' characteristic spectra (e.g., red optical, UV emission, and weak X-ray/IR/radio signals).

Method: Simulated gas accretion in massive halos (Mh ~1e10-11 Msun) at z=4-10, tracking BH growth via super-Eddington accretion and starburst dynamics. Analyzed spectral evolution and feedback effects from supernovae.

Result: Confirmed LRDs' V-shaped UV-to-optical spectra arise from BH envelope (red optical) and starburst (blue UV). Supernova feedback quenches BH/starburst activity after 15 Myr, transitioning systems to standard AGN. The LRD population's optical/UV ratio declines post z~8 due to envelope dissipation.

Conclusion: LRDs are transitional objects in BH-starburst coevolution, critical for understanding early AGN/galaxy evolution. Observational identification of LRDs at specific redshifts can track this evolutionary phase shift driven by feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: The birth of seeds of massive black holes (BHs) and nascent galaxies at
cosmic dawn takes place in dense gaseous environments, which play a crucial
role in shaping their coevolution and radiation spectra. We investigate gas
accretion during the assembly of massive halos with $M_{\rm h}\gtrsim
10^{10-11}~M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\simeq 4-10$, driving both rapid BH feeding
and concurrent nuclear starbursts. As the BH grows to $\sim 10^{6-7}~M_\odot$
via super-Eddington accretion, the accretion power inflates a dense envelope
whose effective temperature approaches the Hayashi limit at $T_{\rm eff}\simeq
5000~{\rm K}$, producing red optical emission, while a coeval young stellar
population of $\sim 10^7~M_\odot$ provides blue UV emission. This early
coevolving system naturally reproduces the characteristic spectral features of
the so-called little red dots (LRDs), a population of broad-line active
galactic nuclei (AGNs), including the V-shaped UV-to-optical spectra and
weakness of X-ray, infrared, and radio emission. Massive stars in the nuclear
starburst soon explode as supernovae, injecting energy and momentum that expel
gas from the nucleus, quench gas supply to the BH envelope, and ultimately
drive a transition into normal AGN phases. For individual LRDs, the
optical-to-UV luminosity ratio remains nearly constant at $L_{\rm opt}/L_{\rm
UV}\simeq 2-10$ from the onset of accretion bursts for $\simeq 15~{\rm Myr}$,
one-third of the Salpeter time, until quenching by stellar feedback. While this
ratio is sustained for the LRD population at $z\simeq 4-8$, it declines toward
lower redshifts as BHs can no longer maintain red envelopes, thereby losing the
LRD characteristics.

Motivation: JWST的观测显示高红移宇宙中的紫外线明亮星系比ΛCDM模型预测的更多，且形态更成熟。同时，Hubble tension等宇宙学问题促使研究者探索ΛCDM之前的宇宙早期物理。

Method: 首次开展大规模EDE模型的宇宙流体动力学模拟，分析其对早期结构形成的影响，对比JWST观测数据。

Conclusion: 早期宇宙物理（如EDE）可同时解决高红移观测难题与Hubble tension，同时保留ΛCDM的预测成功，为约束超出ΛCDM的模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Early JWST observations have revealed a high-redshift universe more vibrant
than predicted by canonical galaxy-formation models within $\Lambda$CDM,
showing an excess of ultraviolet(UV)-bright, massive, and morphologically
mature galaxies. Departures from $\Lambda$CDM prior to recombination can
imprint signatures on non-linear structure formation at high redshift. In this
paper, we investigate one such scenario - Early Dark Energy, originally
proposed to resolve the Hubble tension - and its implications for these
high-redshift challenges. We present the first large-scale cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations of these models. Modifications to the
pre-recombination expansion history accelerate early structure formation and
produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions in excellent agreement with
JWST measurements, requiring essentially no additional calibrations.
Predictions converge to $\Lambda$CDM at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 3$),
thereby preserving all successes of $\Lambda$CDM. This model also accelerates
the emergence of stellar and gaseous disks, increasing their number densities
by $\sim 0.5$ dex at $z\simeq 6$-7, primarily due to the higher abundance of
massive galaxies. Taken together, these results demonstrate how early-universe
physics can simultaneously reconcile multiple high-redshift challenges and the
Hubble tension while retaining the core achievements of $\Lambda$CDM. This
opens a pathway to constraining a broad class of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models
with forthcoming observations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Infrared (IR) fine-structure line (FSL) emission arises from the radiative
de-excitation of collisionally-excited electrons in atoms and ions. Thanks to
their high luminosities and relatively simple physics, IR FSLs have quickly
become the workhorse for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies in
the nearby and distant Universe. In this review, we introduce the physics of
FSL emission and the diagnostics of the ISM that we can derive from them via
first principle arguments. We summarize the history of FSL observations with a
focus on the far-IR wavelengths and a particular emphasis on the on-going
efforts aimed at characterizing galaxies at cosmic noon and beyond. We explore
the dependence of emission line trends, such as those observed in `line
deficits' or [CII]-SFR relations, as a function of redshift and galaxy types.
Once selection biases are controlled for, IR FSLs are a powerful tool to
constrain the physics of galaxies. The precise redshift information inferred
from fine-structure line observations have enabled tracing their ISM properties
across cosmic reionization. FSL observations have also led to estimates of the
mass of different ISM phases, and of the SFR of distant galaxies. It is thanks
to IR FSL observations that we have been able to measure the internal dynamics
of high-z galaxies, which in turns has allowed us to test, e.g., the onset of
black hole - host galaxy relations in the first billion years of the Universe
and the presence of gas outflows associated with the baryon cycle in galaxies.
Finally, FSLs have provided important clues on the physics of the ISM in the
most distant galaxies known to date. We demonstrate the strength and
limitations of using IR FSLs to advance our understanding of galaxy formation
and evolution in the early universe, and we outline future perspective for the
field.

Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) are an important source of feedback in a variety of
astrophysical contexts. Magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations treating CRs
as a fluid have shown that how their feedback operates is strongly dependent on
their transport properties such as diffusion and streaming. In this paper we
introduce the numerical implementation, in the adaptive-mesh-refinement MHD
code RAMSES, of the grey two-moment formulation of CR fluid dynamics, which
follows the energy density and its associated three-dimensional flux. This
method is tested for CR diffusion, streaming, and advection in a series of
multi-dimensional tests including shocks to check the robustness and stability
of this numerical two-moment CRMHD solver. We finally use the new two-moment CR
implementation in a complex simulation of an isolated galactic disc producing
galaxy-wide outflows launched by small-scale supernova explosions, and compare
it with a previously existing one-moment formulation in the same code.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The study of galaxy A1689-zD1 at z=7.1 using ALMA revealed five components with distinct emissions but no ordered rotation, indicating an early assembly phase. Despite high stellar and dust masses, the galaxy follows local star formation relations, suggesting it might evolve into a disk galaxy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the structure and dynamics of a high-redshift galaxy to understand its formation process and evolution toward modern galaxy structures.

Method: High-resolution ALMA observations in bands 3, 6, and 8 of gravitationally lensed galaxy A1689-zD1, analyzing [CII] and [OIII] emission lines and continuum data to dissect components and assess kinematics.

Result: Five components separated within 2 kpc show varied emissions but no rotation, dynamical mass exceeds stellar mass by an order of magnitude, and the galaxy aligns with local star formation relations despite being in an early assembly phase.

Conclusion: A1689-zD1 is likely in an early merger/assembly phase, obscured optically, and could evolve into a disk galaxy, linking high-redshift systems to present-day structures through hierarchical formation.

Abstract: We observed the gravitationally lensed ($\mu = 9.6\pm0.19$) galaxy A1689-zD1
at $z = 7.1$ in bands 3, 6, and 8 of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array. These high-resolution observations ($\approx 200$ pc) enabled us to
separate the source into five components in the [CII] 158$\mu$m and [OIII]
88$mu$m emission lines within a projected distance of 2 kpc. Even though these
components appear to vary strongly from one another in both their line,
continuum, and optical characteristics, the assembly of components do not show
ordered rotation and appear consistent with simulations of a galaxy system
undergoing the process of assembly. The total dynamical mass of the galaxy
($2\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) is an order of magnitude larger than the
spectrally estimated stellar mass, suggesting a near-complete optical
obscuration of the bulk of the stellar component. Comparing the line ratios as
well as the line properties to other properties such as the star formation
rate, we find that A1689-zD1 is consistent with the relations derived from
local star-forming galaxies. Even though A1689-zD1 lies on local star formation
scaling relations and has a high dust and stellar mass estimate, the kinematics
suggest it is in an early assembly stage, which could lead to it becoming a
disk galaxy at a later stage.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the evolution of stellar velocity dispersion in the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen) over ~20 million years, finding abrupt jumps and plateaus linked to star formation bursts. It shows expansion rates and age-related velocity differences, suggesting stellar feedback drives its structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the formation and evolution mechanisms of OB associations by studying velocity dispersion trends and their connection to star formation processes.

Method: Analyzed Gaia mission data with radial velocity supplements to track velocity dispersion changes over time, correlating them with star formation events and spatial expansion.

Result: Discovered stepwise velocity dispersion increases coinciding with star formation bursts, higher velocities in younger clusters, and a current expansion rate of 10-12 pc/Myr. Spatial expansion aligns with these changes.

Conclusion: Stellar feedback is the primary driver of Sco-Cen's structured star formation, expansion, and dispersal. Detailed age maps are critical for understanding OB associations.

Abstract: We study how stellar velocity dispersion within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB
association (Sco-Cen) has evolved over approximately 20 million years, from its
formation to the present day. Using data from the \textit{Gaia} mission along
with supplementary stellar radial velocities, we identified a surprising
sequence of abrupt jumps and intervening plateaus in the velocity dispersion
correlating with star formation bursts. These changes in velocity dispersion
coincide with the association expanding in size. We measure a present-day
expansion rate of about 10--12\,pc\,Myr$^{-1}$ and observe that younger star
clusters within the association exhibit higher velocities compared to older
ones. This result, along with the stepwise increase in both velocity dispersion
and spatial extent over time, suggests a structured and sequential star
formation process rather than a random one. This phased evolution strongly
suggests that stellar feedback is the primary driver of Sco-Cen's star
formation history, expansion, and eventual dispersal. Our findings emphasize
the value of precisely characterizing stellar populations within OB
associations, particularly through the creation of detailed, high-resolution
age maps.

TL;DR: The study analyses bulges in dual AGN host galaxies using SDSS data, finding that most are classical bulges or elliptical galaxies resulting from major mergers, suggesting dual AGN prefer evolved systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the structural properties of bulges in dual AGN host galaxies and understand their formation through galaxy mergers.

Method: Used SDSS DR18 images and GALFIT modelling for 2D decomposition of 131 bulges in dual AGN systems from GOTHIC survey, measuring Sersic indices, masses, etc.

Result: Most bulges (105/131) are classical (Sersic n=2–8); 64% are elliptical galaxies. E-E/E-D mergers dominate over D-D. Dual AGN prefer quenched elliptical/classical bulge hosts from major mergers.

Conclusion: Dual AGN systems are linked to evolved, quenched systems via major mergers, favoring classical bulges/ellipticals over star-forming disc galaxies.

Abstract: We present a structural analysis of bulges in dual active galactic nuclei
(AGN) host galaxies. Dual AGN arise in galaxy mergers where both supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) are actively accreting. The AGN are typically embedded in
compact bulges, which appear as luminous nuclei in optical images. Galaxy
mergers can result in bulge growth, often via star formation. The bulges can be
disky (pseudobulges), classical bulges, or belong to elliptical galaxies. Using
SDSS DR18 gri images and GALFIT modelling, we performed 2D decomposition for
131 dual AGN bulges (comprising 61 galaxy pairs and 3 galaxy triplets)
identified in the GOTHIC survey. We derived s\'ersic indices, luminosities,
masses, and scalelengths of the bulges. Most bulges (105/131) are classical,
with s\'ersic indices lying between $n=2$ and $n=8$. Among these, 64% are
elliptical galaxies, while the remainder are classical bulges in disc galaxies.
Only $\sim$20% of the sample exhibit pseudobulges. Bulge masses span
$1.5\times10^9$ to $1.4\times10^{12}\,M_\odot$, with the most massive systems
being ellipticals. Galaxy type matching shows that elliptical--elliptical
(E--E) and elliptical--disc (E--D) mergers dominate over disc--disc (D--D)
mergers. At least one galaxy in two-thirds of the dual AGN systems is
elliptical and only $\sim$30% involve two disc galaxies. Although our sample is
limited, our results suggest that dual AGN preferentially occur in evolved,
red, quenched systems, that typically form via major mergers. They are
predominantly hosted in classical bulges or elliptical galaxies rather than
star-forming disc galaxies.

Abstract: We revisit the Quasar Main Sequence (QMS) by investigating the impact of the
stellar component from the host galaxy (HG) on the emission line spectra of the
active galactic nuclei (AGN). We first detect spectra with broad emission lines
using a line ratio method for a sample of $\sim$3000 high SNR ($>$20) Black
Hole Mapper objects (part of the fifth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey).
We then built the Index diagram, a novel diagnostic tool using the
$z$-corrected spectra, model-free, designed to easily identify spectra with
significant stellar HG contributions and to classify the AGN spectra into three
categories based on AGN-HG dominance: HG-dominated (HGD), Intermediate (INT),
and AGN-dominated (AGND) sources. A colour-$z$ diagram was used to refine the
AGN-HG classification. We subtract the stellar contributions from the HGD and
INT spectra before modeling the AGN spectrum to extract the QMS parameters. Our
QMS reveals that HGD galaxies predominantly occupy the Population B region with
no \rfe, %FWHM$\gtrsim$4000 \kms, with outliers exhibiting \rfe\ $>$ 1, likely
due to HG subtraction residuals and a faint contribution of \hbbc. INT and AGND
spectra show similar distributions in the Population A %FWHM(\hbbc)$<$4000
\kms\ region, while in Population B, %For broader lines, a tail of AGND sources
becomes apparent. Cross-matching with radio, infrared, and X-ray catalogs, we
find that the strongest radio emitters are associated with HGD and INT groups.
Strong X-ray emitters are found in INT and AGND sources, also occupying the AGN
region in the WISE colour diagram.

TL;DR: The analysis of the first two epochs of the NEXUS JWST program reveals 465 high-confidence variable extragalactic sources, primarily likely AGNs, with some possibly being rare transients. LRDs showed no detectable variability with tight upper limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically search for nuclear variability in extragalactic sources using early NEXUS JWST data and study the variability of LRDs to understand their nature.

Method: Difference imaging with NIRCam data using two epochs, 9 months apart, achieving high precision variability detection. Photometric classifications and redshift distribution analysis. Spectroscopic confirmation for LRDs.

Result: 465 variables detected with >3σ significance; variables match parent sample's redshift up to z>10. LRDs show no variability, with F444W variability limits of 3-10%.

Conclusion: NIRCam's high performance facilitates variability studies. AGNs dominate variable sources, but rare transients exist. LRDs have weak continuum variability, aiding in understanding their active nuclei.

Abstract: The multi-cycle JWST Treasury program NEXUS will obtain cadenced imaging and
spectroscopic observations around the North Ecliptic Pole during 2024-2028.
Here we report a systematic search for nuclear variability among $\sim 25\,$k
sources covered by NIRCam (F200W+F444W) imaging using the first two NEXUS
epochs separated by 9 months in the observed frame. Difference imaging
techniques reach $1\sigma$ variability sensitivity of 0.18~mag (F200W) and
0.15~mag (F444W) at 28th magnitude (within 0".2 diameter aperture), improved to
$0.01$~mag and $0.02$~mag at $<25$th magnitude, demonstrating the superb
performance of NIRCam photometry. The difference imaging results represent
significant improvement over aperture photometry on individual epochs (by
$>30\%$). We identify 465 high-confidence variable sources among the parent
sample, with 2-epoch flux difference at $>3\sigma$ from the fiducial
variability sensitivity. Essentially all these variable sources are of
extragalactic origin based on preliminary photometric classifications, and
follow a similar photometric redshift distribution as the parent sample up to
$z_{\rm phot}>10$. While the majority of these variability candidates are
likely normal unobscured AGNs, some of them may be rare nuclear stellar
transients and tidal disruption events that await confirmation with
spectroscopy and continued photometric monitoring. We also constrain the
photometric variability of ten spectroscopically confirmed broad-line Little
Red Dots (LRDs) at $3\lesssim z \lesssim 7$, and find none of them show
detectable variability in either band. We derive stringent $3\sigma$ upper
limits on the F444W variability of $\sim 3-10\%$ for these LRDs, with a median
value of $\sim 5\%$. These constraints imply weak variability in the rest-frame
optical continuum of LRDs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding how active galactic nuclei (AGN) affect their host galaxies
requires determining their total radiative power across all wavelengths (i.e.,
bolometric luminosities). We show how AGN accretion disk spectral energy
distribution (SED) templates, parameterized by supermassive black hole (SMBH)
mass, Eddington ratio, spin, and inclination, can be used to estimate total
radiated luminosities. Bolometric luminosities are calculated by integrating
the accretion disk SEDs from 1$\mu$m to 10keV over $0^\circ$--$90^\circ$
inclinations, ensuring consistent treatment of wavelength gaps, avoiding
double-counting reprocessed emission, and accounting for anisotropy of
visible--UV emission at different inclinations. The SED, and resulting
bolometric corrections, depend strongly on SMBH mass and Eddington ratio, but
only weakly on spin and inclination. Increasing SMBH mass produces cooler disks
peaking at lower frequencies, whereas higher Eddington ratios (and spins) yield
hotter disks peaking at higher frequencies. Larger inclinations suppress the
visible--UV portion of the SED, whereas X-ray emission remains nearly
isotropic. Bolometric corrections in the visible--NUV range (5100\AA-3000\AA)
show strong dependence on SMBH mass, while X-ray bolometric corrections depend
strongly on the Eddington ratio. Near the SED peak (FUV; $\sim$1450\AA),
parameter dependencies are weak, making this band particularly robust for
estimating bolometric corrections. The X-ray band is reliable, though
dependence on the Eddington ratio introduces a wide dynamic range. Because our
SEDs are intrinsic and defined in the rest-frame, their application to Type 1
AGN is straightforward. For other AGN, however, corrections for obscuration by
the host galaxy and torus are required in many cases.

Abstract: Gas accretion from both the circum-galactic medium (CGM)/inter-galatic medium
(IGM) and interacting companion galaxy can dilute the gas phase metallicity of
a galaxy. However, their relative contribution to the chemical evolution of
galaxies remains to be quantified. To this end, in this work we study a sample
of 510 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) having anomalously low-metallicity (ALM)
regions selected from the MaNGA data available in the Data Release 17 from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. ALM regions are defined as those having gas phase
metallicities that are at least $\sim 2\sigma$ lower than the emprical relation
between stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_{*}$) and gas phase metallicity,
i.e., the $\Sigma_{*}-Z$ relation. We find that ALM galaxies have higher star
formation rates and \Hi~gas fractions than normal SFGs at fixed $M_*$.
$\sim$25\% of the ALM galaxies exhibit tidal features, while the tidal fraction
is only $\sim$12\% for normal SFGs, indicating that galaxy interaction is an
important factor responsible for the ALM phenomenon. To explore the origin of
non-tidal ALM galaxies, we compare their morphologies and environments with
those of mass-matched normal SFGs. We find that non-tidal ALM galaxies tend to
have more disk-dominated morphologies and reside in less-dense environment.
These findings suggest that cold gas accretion from the CGM/IGM is the primary
cause for the ALM phenomenon, while galaxy interaction plays a minor but
non-negligible role.

TL;DR: The study reanalyzes Alpha-element abundances in GCIRS 22 using advanced NLTE models, finding solar-scale values that challenge previous results and suggest episodic star formation in the Galactic Centre.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve discrepancies in earlier abundance analyses by applying updated spectral models and NLTE corrections, critical for understanding the chemical evolution of the Galactic Centre's Nuclear Star Cluster.

Method: High-res近 infrared spectra analyzed with current line lists and Scandium-based stellar parameters. Precise NLTE corrections applied to Si and Ca abundances.

Result: Obtained solar-scale [Ca/Fe] = 0.06 and [Si/Fe] = -0.08, significantly lower than prior LTE estimates. NLTE reduced Ca by 0.3 dex, aligning with recent studies.

Conclusion: Lower alpha-abundances indicate recent star formation wasn't dominated by Type II SNe, supporting episodic star formation with quiescent phases or disk gas inflows driven by Galactic bar dynamics.

Abstract: Context: The chemical abundances of alpha-elements in Galactic Centre (GC)
supergiants provide key insights into the chemical enrichment and star
formation history of the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster. Previous studies
have reported enhanced alpha-element abundances, raising questions about the
chemical evolution of this unique region.
  Aims: We aim to reassess the alpha-element abundances in the GC supergiant
GCIRS 22 using updated spectral modelling and non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium (NLTE) corrections to resolve discrepancies from earlier abundance
analyses.
  Methods: High-resolution near-infrared spectra of GCIRS 22 were analysed
using contemporary line lists and precise stellar parameters derived from
scandium line diagnostics. We applied comprehensive NLTE corrections to
accurately determine the abundances of silicon and calcium.
  Results: Our analysis reveals solar-scale alpha abundances ([Ca/Fe] = 0.06
$\pm$ 0.07; [Si/Fe] = $-$0.08 $\pm$ 0.20) for GCIRS 22, significantly lower
than previous LTE-based findings. NLTE corrections reduce the calcium abundance
by approximately 0.3,dex compared to LTE estimates, aligning our results with
recent studies and highlighting the importance of accurate NLTE modelling.
  Conclusions: The solar-scale alpha-element abundances observed in GCIRS 22
suggest that recent star formation in the region has not been dominated by Type
II supernovae, such as those expected from a recent starburst. Our findings
support a scenario of episodic star formation, characterized by intermittent
bursts separated by extended quiescent phases, or potentially driven by gas
inflows from the inner disk, funnelled by the Galactic bar. Future
comprehensive NLTE studies of additional GC stars will be essential for
refining our understanding of the region's chemical evolution and star
formation history.

TL;DR: 本研究利用Auriga项目中的23个模拟银河系，分析了不同星系组分（恒星晕、核球、暖/冷星盘）在形成历史、恒星年龄和金属丰度关系下的元素分布与起源。发现各组分具有独特的化学趋势：恒星晕α增强且大部分恒星来自外源（50%），金属丰度[Fe/H]约为-0.6；暖星盘和冷星盘金属丰度分别为-0.1和0，内源恒星占比高达90%和95%；核球主要由内源恒星形成，但恒星种群更多样化。年龄-金属丰度关系是塑造化学性质的主要因素。

Motivation: 理解银河系类似星系不同 stellar components 的化学元素分布与其质量增长历史、恒星年龄和金属丰度之间的关系，揭示星系演化过程中的物质来源和形成机制。

Method: 基于Auriga项目的23个模拟星系，在z=0时分解分析恒星晕、核球、暖/冷星盘的化学元素分布，并回溯其起源。通过追踪恒星核合成产物的演化，比较各组分的化学特征差异。

Result: 各组分化学趋势显著不同：恒星晕α增强，金属丰度较低且外源占比较高；冷星盘化学性质高度一致但形成时间差异大；核球存在多样恒星种群；部分暖星盘恒星最初形成于冷星盘，可能与棒状结构和卫星互动有关。

Conclusion: 年龄-金属丰度关系是化学性质分化的主因。冷星盘化学特性高度相似，核球因包含不同年龄恒星而最不均匀。恒星迁移（如从冷盘移向暖盘）与星系内部结构演化（棒形成）及卫星相互作用相关。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the distribution and origin of chemical
elements in different stellar components of simulated Milky Way-like galaxies
in relation to their mass assembly history, stellar age, and metallicity. Using
a sample of 23 simulated galaxies from the Auriga project, we analysed the
evolution of heavy elements produced by stellar nucleosynthesis. To study the
chemical evolution of the stellar halo, bulge, and warm and cold discs of the
model galaxies, we applied a decomposition method to characterise the
distribution of chemical elements at $z=0$ and traced back their origin. Our
findings indicate that each stellar component has a distinctive chemical trend
despite galaxy-to-galaxy variations. Specifically, stellar haloes are
$\alpha$-enhanced relative to other components, representing the oldest
populations, with [Fe/H] ~ $-$0.6 and a high fraction of ex situ stars of ~
50%. They are followed by the warm ([Fe/H] ~ $-$0.1) and cold ([Fe/H] ~ 0)
discs, with in situ fractions of ~ 90% and ~ 95%, respectively. Alternatively,
bulges are mainly formed in situ but host more diverse stellar populations,
with [Fe/H] abundance extending over ~ 1 dex around the solar value. We
conclude that one of the main drivers shaping the chemical properties of the
galactic components in our simulations is the age-metallicity relation. The
bulges are the least homogeneous component of the sample, as they present
different levels of contribution from young stars in addition to the old
stellar component. Conversely, the cold discs appear very similar in all
chemical properties, despite important differences in their typical formation
times. Finally, we find that a significant fraction of stars in the warm discs
were in the cold disc at birth. We discuss the possible connections of this
behaviour with the development of bars and interactions with satellites.

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析277个低面亮度星系(LSB)的恒星形成特性，发现它们尽管拥有大量原子氢气体，但恒星形成效率极低（中位耗尽时间约18Gyr），这可能源于亚千秒差距尺度上的低气体密度和分子气体缺乏。

Motivation: 低面亮度星系对银河系演化模型构成挑战，研究其恒星形成机制有助于理解不同星系类别的物理条件差异。

Method: 使用GALEX-SDSS-WISE和ALFALFA目录构造包含277个LSB星系的样本，应用恒星形成主序列和综合Kennicutt-Schmidt关系分析其恒星形成行为，并与正常恒星形成星系对比。

Result: LSB星系的原子气-恒星质量比和恒星形成主序列趋势与高面亮度星系相似，但原子气体转化为恒星的效率显著更低（中位耗尽时间≈18Gyr）。

Conclusion: LSB星系的低恒星形成效率可能由亚千秒差距尺度的低原子气体密度和分子气体缺乏导致，解释了其低面亮度的成因。

Abstract: Classical low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies pose an important challenge
to galaxy evolution models. While they are found to host large reservoirs of
atomic hydrogen, they display low stellar and star-formation surface densities.
Global star formation scaling relations characterize trends in the star
formation behaviour of galaxies; when used to compare populations or classes of
galaxies, deviations in the observed trends can be used to probe predicted
differences in physical conditions. In this work we utilize the well-studied
Star Forming Main Sequence and integrated Kennicutt-Schmidt Relations to
characterize star formation in the LSB regime, and compare the observed trends
to relations for a normal star-forming galaxies. Using a comprehensive
cross-matched sample of 277 LSB galaxies from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy
Catalog Release 2 and the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array
Catalog, we gain an in-depth view of the star formation process in the LSB
regime. HI-selected LSB galaxies follow very similar trends in atomic
gas-to-stellar mass ratio and the star forming main sequence to their high
surface brightness counterparts. However, while LSB galaxies host comparably
large atomic gas reservoirs, they prove to be largely inefficient in converting
this gas to stars with a median depletion time $t_{dep} \approx 18$ Gyr. These
results are discussed in relation to previous studies which find that LSB
galaxies host low atomic gas densities and are largely deficient in molecular
gas, which suggest that the faint appearance of LSB galaxies may be the result
of physical conditions on the sub-kpc scale.

Abstract: We report the discovery of 164 compact (radius < 1 arcmin) radio rings using
MeerKAT 1.3 GHz data from the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (l=2-60deg,
252-358deg, |b|<1.5deg) and the Galactic Centre mosaic, from a search aimed at
identifying previously uncatalogued radio sources. Within this sample,
approximately 19 per cent of the rings contain a central point radio source. A
multiwavelength analysis reveals a striking diversity: about 40 per cent of the
rings enclose an isolated infrared point source, 50 per cent exhibit an
extended counterpart in the mid- or far-infrared, and several are only detected
in the radio band. We found that 17 per cent of the rings in the sample are
positionally coincident (within 5 arcsec) with known entries in SIMBAD,
including unclassified infrared sources, spiral galaxies, young stellar objects
and long-period variable candidates. Based on these matches and exploiting
ancillary multiwavelength data and catalogues, we explore several formation
scenarios for the rings, such as HII regions, planetary nebulae, mass-loss
relics from evolved massive stars, supernova remnants, nova shells, galaxies,
galaxy cluster lenses and odd radio circles. Tentative classifications are
proposed for nearly 60 per cent of the sample. These results highlight the
potential of MeerKAT to uncover previously undetected compact radio structures
and, particularly, recover missing Galactic radio-emitting objects.

### [30] [Stars and ionized gas in UGCA 320: a nearby gas-rich, dwarf Irregular galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20359)
*Adebusola B. Alabi,S. Ilani Loubser,Moses K. Mogotsi,N. Zabel*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: This study investigates UGCA 320, a gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxy, using HST, SALT/RSS, and VLT/MUSE data. It finds that the galaxy's stellar and ionized gas discs have contrasting kinematic properties, a sharp transition at ~0.3 kpc, and outer disc distortions, suggesting a recent tidal interaction with neighbor UGCA 319.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics and evolution of UGCA 320 in its isolated group environment, focusing on stellar/gas interactions and the impact of tidal forces.

Method: Combined analysis of multi-band HST imaging, SALT/RSS long-slit spectra, and VLT/MUSE integral-field spectral data to examine stellar/gas components and their kinematics.

Result: 发现了年轻(~1.2亿年)、金属含量少(15-30%太阳金属丰度)的恒星盘与电离气体盘具有相同旋转方向但速度更高，可能位于不同平面。在~0.3 kpc处存在动力学特性突变和外盘畸变，与近期潮汐交互相符。

Conclusion: 潮汐交互可能是导致UGCA 320结构和动力学特征变化的主要原因，且长狭缝与整体场数据分析独立支持该结论。这对矮星系相互作用的演化研究具有重要启示。

Abstract: UGCA 320 is a gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxy which belongs to a nearby,
relatively isolated group of dwarf galaxies. Here, we combine multi-band HST
imaging data with deep long-slit SALT/RSS and integral-field VLT/MUSE spectral
data to study the stellar and ionized gas components of UGCA 320. Our imaging
data analysis reveals a very blue (V-I~0.1 mag), flattened radial colour
profile. We detect an abundance of ionized gas in UGCA 320 powered mostly by
recent star formation. The stellar disc in UGCA 320 is populated predominantly
by young (~120 Myr) and metal-poor (~15-30 per cent solar metallicity) stars
and it rotates in the same sense as the ionized gas disc but with higher
rotation velocities, and possibly in different planes. Our analysis reveals a
sharp transition in the kinematic properties of the discs at radius ~10" (~0.3
kpc) and distortions in the outer disc region. We show that these features are
consistent with a recent tidal interaction most likely with its close neighbour
- UGCA 319. We discuss our results in the context of interacting dwarf galaxies
and also show that similar inferences can be made independently from the
long-slit data analysis as with the integral-field data.

Abstract: Hydrogen recombination lines are key diagnostics of ionized gas in the
interstellar medium (ISM), particularly within photoionized nebulae.
Hydrodynamical simulations, even those that include radiative transfer, do not
usually determine the level population of hydrogen required to compute line
intensities, but rather interpolate them from pre-computed tables. Here we
present the HyLight atomic model, which captures the dominant processes
governing the level populations, enabling the calculation of all dipole-allowed
hydrogen transitions as well as two-photon transitions from the 2s to 1s state
without the need to pre-computed tables. We compare HyLight predictions to
those of other codes and published tables, finding differences between the
various rates of up to factors of several per cent for common transitions,
including those of the Balmer and Brackett series. However, we find sub-per
cent agreement between HyLight and the Cloudy spectral synthesis code when
enforcing photo-ionisation equilibrium in gas under typical nebular conditions
of density and temperature. Importantly, HyLight can also predict emissivities
if the gas is not in photo-ionisation equilibrium. As examples, we compute the
ratios between the total photoionization rate and line intensities in a nebula,
and post-process a snapshot from Sparcs, a hydrodynamical code that combines
radiative transfer with non-equilibrium physics, and compute mock hydrogen
emission line maps which can be compared directly to observations. Implemented
in Python, HyLight is an accurate tool for determining the level population in
neutral hydrogen, a crucial step in bridging the gap between simulations and
observations in studies of photoionized regions in galaxies.
